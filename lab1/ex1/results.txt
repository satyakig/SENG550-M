THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	
	
THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE	
	
To eat the world’s due, by the grave and thee.	
	
For where is she so fair whose uneared womb	
4	
So great a sum of sums yet canst not live?	
For never-resting time leads summer on	
Beauty’s effect with beauty were bereft,	
With beauty’s treasure ere it be self-killed:	
That’s for thy self to breed another thee,	
Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,	
	
Lifts up his burning head, each under eye	
Like feeble age he reeleth from the day,	
From his low tract and look another way:	
Why lov’st thou that which thou receiv’st not gladly,	
By unions married do offend thine ear,	
9	
Ah, if thou issueless shalt hap to die,	
The world will wail thee like a makeless wife,	
By children’s eyes, her husband’s shape in mind:	
10	
That beauty still may live in thine or thee.	
In one of thine, from that which thou departest,	
If all were minded so, the times should cease,	
Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard:	
Against the stormy gusts of winter’s day	
Or else of thee this I prognosticate,	
	
	
The age to come would say this poet lies,	
Such heavenly touches ne’er touched earthly faces.	
And stretched metre of an antique song.	
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,	
When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st,	
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,	
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood,	
And do whate’er thou wilt swift-footed Time	
But I forbid thee one most heinous crime,	
20	
So is it not with me as with that muse,	
With sun and moon, with earth and sea’s rich gems:	
O therefore love be of thyself so wary,	
To hear with eyes belongs to love’s fine wit.	
	
24	
Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled,	
Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done,	
Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun	
Let those who are in favour with their stars,	
Of public honour and proud titles boast,	
Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars	
Is from the book of honour razed quite,	
	
	
But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,	
	
Their images I loved, I view in thee,	
A dearer birth than this his love had brought	
To march in ranks of better equipage:	
33	
All men make faults, and even I in this,	
That I an accessary needs must be,	
	
Although our undivided loves are one:	
Unless thou take that honour from thy name:	
As a decrepit father takes delight,	
So then I am not lame, poor, nor despised,	
This wish I have, then ten times happy me.	
38	
While thou dost breathe that pour’st into my verse,	
Eternal numbers to outlive long date.	
The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.	
39	
When thou art all the better part of me?	
All mine was thine, before thou hadst this more:	
Then if for my love, thou my love receivest,	
	
Gentle thou art, and therefore to be won,	
And when a woman woos, what woman’s son,	
Who lead thee in their riot even there	
If I lose thee, my loss is my love’s gain,	
When most I wink then do mine eyes best see,	
Until life’s composition be recured,	
And says in him thy fair appearance lies.	
Art left the prey of every vulgar thief.	
Thee have I not locked up in any chest,	
Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,	
To leave poor me, thou hast the strength of laws,	
Doth teach that case and that repose to say	
’Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend.’	
The bloody spur cannot provoke him on,	
More sharp to me than spurring to his side,	
For that same groan doth put this in my mind,	
When swift extremity can seem but slow?	
52	
The which he will not every hour survey,	
Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope,	
Speak of the spring, and foison of the year,	
	
	
When wasteful war shall statues overturn,	
’Gainst death, and all-oblivious enmity	
That wear this world out to the ending doom.	
So till the judgment that your self arise,	
56	
	
The spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness:	
59	
To this composed wonder of your frame,	
	
Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,	
Is it thy spirit that thou send’st from thee	
And for my self mine own worth do define,	
	
	
Increasing store with loss, and loss with store.	
Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back,	
Tired with all these, from these would I be gone,	
Ah wherefore with infection should he live,	
	
Thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned,	
But those same tongues that give thee so thine own,	
A crow that flies in heaven’s sweetest air.	
To tie up envy, evermore enlarged,	
Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.	
	
	
	
Bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.	
As after sunset fadeth in the west,	
The prey of worms, my body being dead,	
And for the peace of you I hold such strife	
	
76	
For as the sun is daily new and old,	
	
Shall profit thee, and much enrich thy book.	
Thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing,	
Yet be most proud of that which I compile,	
But now my gracious numbers are decayed,	
To make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame.	
He of tall building, and of goodly pride.	
Then if he thrive and I be cast away,	
Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,	
	
And precious phrase by all the Muses filed.	
	
Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?	
No, neither he, nor his compeers by night	
	
Comes home again, on better judgement making.	
89	
Speak of my lameness, and I straight will halt:	
Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,	
Come in the rearward of a conquered woe,	
And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,	
And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,	
Wherein it finds a joy above the rest,	
Thy love is better than high birth to me,	
Of more delight than hawks and horses be:	
And life no longer than thy love will stay,	
For it depends upon that love of thine.	
How like Eve’s apple doth thy beauty grow,	
	
That do not do the thing, they most do show,	
For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds,	
That tongue that tells the story of thy days,	
(Making lascivious comments on thy sport)	
Where beauty’s veil doth cover every blot,	
To truths translated, and for true things deemed.	
That leaves look pale, dreading the winter’s near.	
Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:	
	
A vengeful canker eat him up to death.	
Return forgetful Muse, and straight redeem,	
	
For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?	
Then do thy office Muse, I teach thee how,	
103	
Look in your glass and there appears a face,	
That over-goes my blunt invention quite,	
Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned,	
Ere you were born was beauty’s summer dead.	
	
Fair, kind, and true, is all my argument,	
Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,	
107	
Can yet the lease of my true love control,	
	
Finding the first conceit of love there bred,	
The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,	
Than public means which public manners breeds.	
	
My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue.	
And my great mind most kingly drinks it up,	
To give full growth to that which still doth grow.	
	
But bears it out even to the edge of doom:	
Forgot upon your dearest love to call,	
That I have frequent been with unknown minds,	
And on just proof surmise, accumulate,	
	
’Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed,	
When not to be, receives reproach of being,	
Till each to razed oblivion yield his part	
Made more or less by thy continual haste:	
	
With my extern the outward honouring,	
And her quietus is to render thee.	
At such who not born fair no beauty lack,	
	
The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,	
Th’ expense of spirit in a waste of shame	
Past reason hunted, and no sooner had	
Had, having, and in quest, to have extreme,	
	
130	
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.	
	
Yet in good faith some say that thee behold,	
A thousand groans but thinking on thy face,	
O let it then as well beseem thy heart	
	
A torment thrice three-fold thus to be crossed:	
	
Thou usurer that put’st forth all to use,	
135	
If thy soul check thee that I come so near,	
	
137	
That they behold and see not what they see?	
In things right true my heart and eyes have erred,	
I do believe her though I know she lies,	
No news but health from their physicians know.	
For if I should despair I should grow mad,	
141	
But ’tis my heart that loves what they despise,	
Only my plague thus far I count my gain,	
	
In pursuit of the thing she would have stay:	
Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent,	
And whether that my angel be turned fiend,	
	
Angry that his prescriptions are not kept	
Hath left me, and I desperate now approve,	
Desire is death, which physic did except.	
Past cure I am, now reason is past care,	
On whom frown’st thou that I do fawn upon,	
Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?	
	
A maid of Dian’s this advantage found,	
And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep	
Growing a bath and healthful remedy,	
Came there for cure and this by that I prove,

In thy fats our cares be drown'd,

Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,

Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day	
Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.	
What, will you walk with me about the town,

So great a charge from thine own custody?	
And strike you home without a messenger.

ACT II. SCENE 1	
And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner;	
Are their males' subjects, and at their controls.	
Man, more divine, the master of all these,	
Of more pre-eminence than fish and fowls,	
A wretched soul, bruis'd with adversity,	
We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;	
With urging helpless patience would relieve me;	
'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?'	
'My mistress, sir,' quoth I; 'Hang up thy mistress;	
ADRIANA. Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.	
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. And he will bless that cross with other beating;	
What ruins are in me that can be found	
A sunny look of his would soon repair.	
And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.	
	
Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner!	
For which, I hope, thou felt'st I was displeas'd.	
Do use you for my fool and chat with you,	
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Dost thou not know?	
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thank me, sir! for what?	
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Basting.	
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. If it be, sir, I pray you eat none of it.	
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, learn to jest in good time;	
And that this body, consecrate to thee,	
And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring,	
I live dis-stain'd, thou undishonoured.	
As strange unto your town as to your talk,	
Who, every word by all my wit being scann'd,	
Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.	
Unless it be by inspiration?	
Abetting him to thwart me in my mood!	
But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt.	
Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,	
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. O, for my beads! I cross me for sinner.	
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou hast thine own form.	
ADRIANA. Come, come, no longer will I be a fool,	
Sleeping or waking, mad or well-advis'd?	
	
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Maud, Bridget, Marian, Cicely, Gillian, Ginn!

I have not din'd to-day.

And that supposed by the common rout	
And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;	
Then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness;	
Look sweet, speak fair, become disloyalty;	
Be secret-false. What need she be acquainted?	
Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife.	
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Sweet mistress-what your name is else, I know	
Against my soul's pure truth why labour you	
To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears.	
And in that glorious supposition think

Of such enchanting presence and discourse,	
For fear you ne'er see chain nor money more.	
I shall receive the money for the same.	
I will discharge my bond, and thank you too.	
And buy a rope's end; that will I bestow	
For locking me out of my doors by day.	
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. A man is well holp up that trusts to you!	
Belike you thought our love would last too long,	
ANGELO. Saving your merry humour, here's the note

If he should scorn me so apparently.

PINCH. It is no shame; the fellow finds his vein,	
They must be bound, and laid in some dark room.

And, not without some scandal to yourself,	
Who, but for staying on our controversy,	
Had hoisted sail and put to sea to-day.	
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou art a villain to impeach me thus;	
And what's a fever but a fit of madness?	
In food, in sport, and life-preserving rest,	
Till I have us'd the approved means I have,	
ADRIANA. I will not hence and leave my husband here;	
ABBESS. Be quiet, and depart; thou shalt not have him.	
	
Who I made lord of me and all I had	
A most outrageous fit of madness took him,	
He broke from those that had the guard of him,	
Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,	
	
That hath abused and dishonoured me	
ADRIANA. No, my good lord. Myself, he, and my sister,	
To-day did dine together. So befall my soul	
In this the madman justly chargeth them.	
Which, God he knows, I saw not; for the which	
Cries out I was possess'd. Then all together	
They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence,	
And in a dark and dankish vault at home	
To give me ample satisfaction	
SECOND MERCHANT. Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine	
I never saw the chain, so help me Heaven!	
If here you hous'd him, here he would have been;	
If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly.

For lately we were bound as you are now.	
And careful hours with time's deformed hand

As for your spiteful false objections,

KING HENRY. Uncle, what shall we say to this in law?	
PETER. Alas, my lord, I cannot fight; for God's sake, pity my case!	
The spite of man prevaileth against me. O Lord, have mercy upon	
me, I shall never be able to fight a blow! O Lord, my heart!

See you well guerdon'd for these good deserts.

But him outlive, and die a violent death.'

come to that!	
I'll shave your crown for this,	
GLOUCESTER. What means this noise?	
TOWNSMAN. A miracle! A miracle!	
Gives light in darkness, comfort in despair!	
	
Enter the MAYOR OF SAINT ALBANS and his brethren,	
bearing Simpcox between two in a chair;	
GLOUCESTER. Stand by, my masters; bring him near the King;	
QUEEN. Tell me, good fellow, cam'st thou here by chance,	
WIFE. Most true, forsooth; and many time and oft	
CARDINAL. What, art thou lame?	
SIMPCOX. Alas, good master, my wife desir'd some damsons	
Christendom. If thou hadst been born blind, thou mightst as well	
do wear. Sight may distinguish of colours; but suddenly to	
SIMPCOX. O master, that you could!	
You made in a day, my lord, whole towns to fly.	
And, vanquish'd as I am, I yield to the	
Or to the meanest groom.	
And look thyself be faultless, thou wert best.

Noble she is; but if she have forgot	
Honour and virtue, and convers'd with such	
That hath dishonoured Gloucester's honest name.

With honour of his birthright to the crown.

Peter, thou hast prevail'd in right!	
Sound a flourish. Exeunt	
To watch the coming of my punish'd duchess.	
Uneath may she endure the flinty streets	
To tread them with her tender-feeling feet.	
Sweet Nell, ill can thy noble mind abrook	
And thou a prince, Protector of this land,	
Trowest thou that e'er I'll look upon the world	
Thy greatest help is quiet, gentle Nell.	
GLOUCESTER. And my consent ne'er ask'd herein before!	
And I may live to do you kindness if	
DUCHESS. Art thou gone too? All comfort go with thee!	
Small curs are not regarded when they grin,	
First note that he is near you in descent,	
If it be fond, can it a woman's fear;	
As next the King he was successive heir-	
Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep,	
Levy great sums of money through the realm	
To mow down thorns that would annoy our foot,	
Take heed, my lord; the welfare of us all	
	
Nor change my countenance for this arrest:	
And, being Protector, stay'd the soldiers' pay;	
CARDINAL. It serves you well, my lord, to say so much.	
Unless it were a bloody murderer,	
Above the felon or what trespass else.	
And here commit you to my Lord Cardinal	
And equity exil'd your Highness' land.	
By false accuse doth level at my life.	
My liefest liege to be mine enemy;	
The ancient proverb will be well effected:	
And wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first.	
KING HENRY. My lords, what to your wisdoms seemeth best	
Whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes;	
For what's more miserable than discontent?	
And yet, good Humphrey, is the hour to come	
That these great lords, and Margaret our Queen,	
Even so, remorseless, have they borne him hence;	
To rid us from the fear we have of him.	
CARDINAL. That he should die is worthy policy;	
No; let him die, in that he is a fox,	
For things are often spoke and seldom meant;	
But that my heart accordeth with my tongue,	
It skills not greatly who impugns our doom.	
He never would have stay'd in France so long.	
I rather would have lost my life betimes	
QUEEN. Nay then, this spark will prove a raging fire,	
Then, noble York, take thou this task in hand.	
And change misdoubt to resolution;	
I have seduc'd a headstrong Kentishman,	
Under the tide of John Mortimer.	
Were almost like a sharp-quill'd porpentine;	
And given me notice of their villainies.	
This devil here shall be my substitute;	
In face, in gait, in speech, he doth resemble.	
By this I shall perceive the commons' mind,	
Didst ever hear a man so penitent?	
Pray God he may acquit him of suspicion!	
Re-enter SUFFOLK	
	
KING. O heavenly God!	
QUEEN. How fares my gracious lord?	
SUFFOLK. Comfort, my sovereign! Gracious Henry, comfort!	
Can chase away the first conceived sound?	
Yet he most Christian-like laments his death;	
I would be blind with weeping, sick with groans,	
It may be judg'd I made the Duke away;	
And princes' courts be fill'd with my reproach.	
What, art thou like the adder waxen deaf?	
Did seem to say 'Seek not a scorpion's nest,	
And bid them blow towards England's blessed shore,	
My earnest-gaping sight of thy land's view,	
And threw it towards thy land. The sea receiv'd it;	
When he to madding Dido would unfold	
For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long.	
Some violent hands were laid on Humphrey's life!	
And with my fingers feel his hand un-feeling;	
Look, on the sheets his hair, you see, is sticking;	
His well-proportion'd beard made rough and rugged,	
It cannot be but he was murd'red here:	
Who finds the partridge in the puttock's nest	
Though Suffolk dare him twenty thousand times.	
WARWICK. Madam, be still- with reverence may I say;	
And I should rob the deathsman of his fee,	
If from this presence thou dar'st go with me.	
WARWICK. Away even now, or I will drag thee hence.	
SUFFOLK. The trait'rous Warwick, with the men of Bury,	
shall know your mind.	
That slily glided towards your Majesty,	
Lest, being suffer'd in that harmful slumber,	
My tongue should stumble in mine earnest words,	
Well could I curse away a winter's night,	
Where biting cold would never let grass grow,	
And think it but a minute spent in sport.	
So, get thee gone, that I may know my grief;	
'Tis but surmis'd whiles thou art standing by,	
Adventure to be banished myself;	
For where thou art, there is the world itself,	
VAUX. To signify unto his Majesty	
And whispers to his pillow, as to him,	
Here could I breathe my soul into the air,	
QUEEN. Away! Though parting be a fretful corrosive,	
I'll have an Iris that shall find thee out.	
This way fall I to death.	
Enough to purchase such another island,	
Give me some drink; and bid the apothecary	
Bring the strong poison that I bought of him.	
O, beat away the busy meddling fiend

And let us all to meditation.                         Exeunt

Thy lips, that kiss'd the Queen, shall sweep the ground;	
And all by thee. Away! convey him hence.	
Upon these paltry, servile, abject drudges!	
It is impossible that I should die	
By such a lowly vassal as thyself.

Nay, do not fright us with an angry look.

To Bedlam with him! Is the man grown mad?	
Makes him oppose himself against his king.

DRAMATIS PERSONAE	
	
EARL OF WARWICK                    EARL OF PEMBROKE	
SIR JOHN SOMERVILLE                TUTOR, to Rutland	
[Throwing down SOMERSET'S head]	
Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.	
And bashful Henry depos'd, whose cowardice	
Even in the chair of state! Belike he means,	
My heart for anger burns; I cannot brook it.	
EXETER. But when the Duke is slain they'll quickly fly.	
To make a shambles of the parliament house!	
WARWICK. True, Clifford; and that's Richard Duke of York.	
WESTMORELAND. He is both King and Duke of Lancaster;	
Thy kinsmen, and thy friends, I'll have more lives	
WARWICK. Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.	
For he that interrupts him shall not live.	
KING HENRY. Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,	
For Richard, in the view of many lords,	
WARWICK. Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd,	
KING HENRY. Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?	
YORK. Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?	
NORTHUMBERLAND. Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay'st,	
Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father!	
and WESTMORELAND	
To seek to put me down and reign thyself.	
YORK. This oath I willingly take, and will perform.	
WARWICK. Long live King Henry! Plantagenet, embrace him.	
KING HENRY. And long live thou, and these thy forward sons!	
Exeunt the YORKISTS	
And never seen thee, never borne thee son,	
Or felt that pain which I did for him once,	
Thou hast undone thyself, thy son, and me;	
And spread they shall be, to thy foul disgrace	
Thus do I leave thee. Come, son, let's away;	
QUEEN MARGARET. Thou hast spoke too much already; get thee gone.	
QUEEN MARGARET. Ay, to be murder'd by his enemies.	
The loss of those three lords torments my heart.	
RICHARD. I'll prove the contrary, if you'll hear me speak.	
YORK. Thou canst not, son; it is impossible.	
Then, seeing 'twas he that made you to depose,	
YORK. Richard, enough; I will be King, or die.	
MESSENGER. The Queen with all the northern earls and lords	
Intend here to besiege you in your castle.	
She is hard by with twenty thousand men;	
MONTAGUE. Brother, I go; I'll win them, fear it not.	
EDWARD. I hear their drums. Let's set our men in order,	
I doubt not, uncle, of our victory.	
	
CLIFFORD. How now, is he dead already? Or is it fear	
Congeal'd with this, do make me wipe off both.          Exit	
	
But this I know- they have demean'd themselves	
Like men born to renown by life or death.	
With this we charg'd again; but out alas!	
With bootless labour swim against the tide	
	
the PRINCE OF WALES, and soldiers	
Whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this!	
NORTHUMBERLAND. Hold, Clifford! do not honour him so much	
And ten to one is no impeach of valour.	
That raught at mountains with outstretched arms,	
And where's that valiant crook-back prodigy,	
What, hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails	
Hold you his hands whilst I do set it on.	
Were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless.	
But, God He knows, thy share thereof is small.	
[Stabbing him]	
Had he been slain, we should have heard the news;	
How fares my brother? Why is he so sad?	
And watch'd him how he singled Clifford forth.	
Methought he bore him in the thickest troop	
See how the morning opes her golden gates	
RICHARD. Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun;	
Should notwithstanding join our lights together	
Your princely father and my loving lord!	
EDWARD. Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon,	
O Clifford, boist'rous Clifford, thou hast slain	
The flow'r of Europe for his chivalry;	
For self-same wind that I should speak withal	
Richard, I bear thy name; I'll venge thy death,	
	
Touching King Henry's oath and your succession.	
Who look'd full gently on his warlike queen,	
Their weapons like to lightning came and went:	
Or like an idle thresher with a flail,	
But all in vain; they had no heart to fight,	
In haste post-haste are come to join with you;	
WARWICK. Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;	
And now to London all the crew are gone	
EDWARD. Then strike up drums. God and Saint George for us!	
CLIFFORD,	
NORTHUMBERLAND, with drum and trumpets	
The smallest worm will turn, being trodden on,	
Were it not pity that this goodly boy	
QUEEN MARGARET. My lord, cheer up your spirits; our foes are nigh,	
EDWARD. Now, perjur'd Henry, wilt thou kneel for grace	
CLIFFORD. And reason too:	
RICHARD. 'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland, was it not?	
CLIFFORD. Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied.	
But ere sunset I'll make thee curse the deed.	
KING HENRY. I prithee give no limits to my tongue:	
That Clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue.	
PRINCE OF WALES. If that be right which Warwick says is right,	
RICHARD. Iron of Naples hid with English gilt,	
Sham'st thou not, knowing whence thou art extraught,	
By that false woman as this king by thee.	
And grac'd thy poor sire with his bridal day,	
That wash'd his father's fortunes forth of France	
Sound trumpets; let our bloody colours wave,	
And either victory or else a grave!	
	
GEORGE. Our hap is lost, our hope but sad despair;	
Thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk,	
'Warwick, revenge! Brother, revenge my death.'	
That stain'd their fetlocks in his smoking blood,	
And ere my knee rise from the earth's cold face	
I that did never weep now melt with woe	
As victors wear at the Olympian games.	
CLIFFORD. Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone.	
	
	
Both tugging to be victors, breast to breast,	
To whom God will, there be the victory!	
How many hours brings about the day,	
So many days my ewes have been with young;	
Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave.	
To kings that fear their subjects' treachery?	
His viands sparkling in a golden cup,	
His body couched in a curious bed,	
	
Alarum. Enter a son that hath kill'd his Father, at	
another door	
This man whom hand to hand I slew in fight	
And I, that haply take them from him now,	
Who's this? O God! It is my father's face,	
But let me see. Is this our foeman's face?	
Upon thy wounds, that kills mine eye and heart!	
This deadly quarrel daily doth beget!	
The other his pale cheeks, methinks, presenteth.	
FATHER. Was ever father so bemoan'd his son?	
Away! for death doth hold us in pursuit.	
And bloody steel grasp'd in their ireful hands,	
EXETER. Away! for vengeance comes along with them.	
Giving no ground unto the house of York,	
Had left no mourning widows for our death;	
And his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak.	
Speak, Clifford, dost thou know who speaks to thee?	
RICHARD. Thou didst love York, and I am son to York.	
EDWARD. Thou pitied'st Rutland, I will pity thee.	
When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath.	
If this right hand would buy two hours' life,	
And, having France thy friend, thou shalt not dread	
	
Will scare the herd, and so my shoot is lost.	
And, for the time shall not seem tedious,	
No humble suitors press to speak for right,	
Is thither gone to crave the French King's sister	
For Warwick is a subtle orator,	
Art then forsaken, as thou went'st forlorn!	
SECOND KEEPER. Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king.	
SECOND KEEPER. Well, if you be a king crown'd with content,	
SECOND KEEPER. No, never such an oath; nor will not now.	
For we were subjects but while you were king.	
Look, as I blow this feather from my face,	
KING HENRY. So would you be again to Henry,	
	
SCENE II. London. The palace	
	
This lady's husband, Sir Richard Grey, was slain,	
The worthy gentleman did lose his life.	
GLOUCESTER. [Aside to CLARENCE] Yea, is it so?	
GLOUCESTER. [Aside] Ay, widow? Then I'll warrant you all your	
leave	
CLARENCE. As red as fire! Nay, then her wax must melt.	
LADY GREY. Why stops my lord? Shall I not hear my task?	
KING EDWARD. An easy task; 'tis but to love a king.	
GLOUCESTER. The match is made; she seals it with a curtsy.	
What love, thinkst thou, I sue so much to get?	
KING EDWARD. Why, then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands.	
KING EDWARD. Therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily.	
KING EDWARD.No more than when my daughters call thee mother.	
KING EDWARD. Brothers, you muse what chat we two have had.	
And brought your prisoner to your palace gate.	
Widow, go you along. Lords, use her honourably.	
And chides the sea that sunders him from thence,	
And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.	
To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub	
To make an envious mountain on my back,	
And am I, then, a man to be belov'd?	
Then, since this earth affords no joy to me	
But toiling desperately to find it out-	
Change shapes with Protheus for advantages,	
	
QUEEN MARGARET. No, mighty King of France. Now Margaret	
LEWIS. Why, say, fair Queen, whence springs this deep despair?	
Now therefore be it known to noble Lewis	
With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry's heir,	
LEWIS. The more I stay, the more I'll succour thee.	
QUEEN MARGARET. Our Earl of Warwick, Edward's greatest friend.	
First to do greetings to thy royal person,	
To England's King in lawful marriage.	
Hath plac'd thy beauty's image and thy virtue.	
Springs not from Edward's well-meant honest love,	
Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;	
Methinks these peers of France should smile at that.	
But for the rest: you tell a pedigree	
Of threescore and two years- a silly time	
Myself have often heard him say and swear	
Then 'tis but reason that I be releas'd	
WARWICK. Henry now lives in Scotland at his case,	
And as for you yourself, our quondam queen,	
POST. My lord ambassador, these letters are for you,	
No more my king, for he dishonours me,	
Thou seest what's past; go fear thy king withal.	
And I am ready to put armour on.	
And Prince shall follow with a fresh supply.	
WARWICK. This shall assure my constant loyalty:	
And I'll be chief to bring him down again;	
	
CLARENCE. Alas, you know 'tis far from hence to France!	
GLOUCESTER. And shall have your will, because our King.	
And you too, Somerset and Montague,	
In them and in ourselves our safety lies.	
And for this once my will shall stand for law.	
Unto the brother of your loving bride.	
She better would have fitted me or Clarence;	
But as this title honours me and mine,	
KING EDWARD. My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns.	
GLOUCESTER. [Aside] I hear, yet say not much, but think the more.	
Enter a POST	
She had the wrong. But what said Henry's queen?	
MESSENGER. He, more incens'd against your Majesty	
'Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong;	
MESSENGER. Ay, gracious sovereign; they are so link'd in friendship	
Tell me if you love Warwick more than me?	
Give me assurance with some friendly vow,	
	
With sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus' tents,	
And brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds,	
You that will follow me to this attempt,	
WARWICK. This is his tent; and see where stand his guard.	
SOMERSET. What are they that fly there?	
When you disgrac'd me in my embassade,	
Nor how to be contented with one wife,	
Nay, then I see that Edward needs must down.	
My Lord of Somerset, at my request,	
When I have fought with Pembroke and his fellows,	
Lewis and the Lady Bona send to him.	
Now for a while farewell, good Duke of York.	
WARWICK. Ay, that's the first thing that we have to do;	
To free King Henry from imprisonment,	
RIVERS. What, loss of some pitch'd battle against Warwick?	
RIVERS. Then is my sovereign slain?	
Is new committed to the Bishop of York,	
Guess thou the rest: King Edward's friends must down.	
There shall I rest secure from force and fraud.	
	
I have advertis'd him by secret means	
	
SCENE VI. London. The Tower	
	
Nay, be thou sure I'll well requite thy kindness,	
Ay, such a pleasure as incaged birds	
For choosing me when Clarence is in place.	
While I myself will lead a private life	
WARWICK. Ay, therein Clarence shall not want his part.	
Suggest but truth to my divining thoughts,	
This pretty lad will prove our country's bliss.	
His head by nature fram'd to wear a crown,	
WARWICK. What news, my friend?	
And fled, as he hears since, to Burgundy.	
And from the Bishop's huntsmen rescu'd him;	
And we shall have more wars befor't be long.	
'Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall down.	
MAYOR. My lords, we were forewarned of your coming	
MAYOR. True, my good lord; I know you for no less.	
So 'twere not long of him; but being ent'red,	
What! fear not, man, but yield me up the keys;	
MONTGOMERY. To help King Edward in his time of storm,	
I came to serve a king and not a duke.	
Drummer, strike up, and let us march away.	
[The drum begins to march]	
KING EDWARD. Nay, stay, Sir John, a while, and we'll debate	
MONTGOMERY. Ay, now my sovereign speaketh like himself;	
Come, fellow soldier, make thou proclamation.	
SOLDIER. [Reads] 'Edward the Fourth, by the grace of God,	
KING EDWARD. Thanks, brave Montgomery, and thanks unto you all;	
If fortune serve me, I'll requite this kindness.	
Above the border of this horizon,	
KING HENRY. Well-minded Clarence, be thou fortunate!	
Methinks the power that Edward hath in field	
I have not stopp'd mine ears to their demands,	
My mercy dried their water-flowing tears;	
I have not been desirous of their wealth,	
KING EDWARD. Seize on the shame-fac'd Henry, bear him hence;	
And once again proclaim us King of England.	
And, lords, towards Coventry bend we our course,	
GLOUCESTER. Away betimes, before his forces join,	
Where is the post that came from Montague?	
WARWICK. Say, Somerville, what says my loving son?	
SOMERVILLE. It is not his, my lord; here Southam lies.	
The drum your Honour hears marcheth from Warwick.	
Where slept our scouts or how are they seduc'd	
And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York.	
I'll do thee service for so good a gift.	
KING EDWARD. 'Tis even so; yet you are Warwick still.	
WARWICK. I had rather chop this hand off at a blow,	
Enter MONTAGUE, with drum and colours	
	
Enter CLARENCE, with drum and colours	
I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe;	
KING EDWARD. What, Warwick, wilt thou leave die town and fight?	
WARWICK. Alas, I am not coop'd here for defence!	
And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe.	
Is nothing left me but my body's length.	
And with thy lips keep in my soul a while!	
'O farewell, Warwick!'	
OXFORD. Away, away, to meet the Queen's great power!	
SCENE III. Another part of the field	
Flourish. Enter KING in triumph; with GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, and the	
But in the midst of this bright-shining day	
Ere he attain his easeful western bed-	
	
Ah, what a shame! ah, what a fault were this!	
And, though unskilful, why not Ned and I	
What Clarence but a quicksand of deceit?	
PRINCE OF WALES. Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit	
And make him naked foil a man-at-arms.	
If any such be here- as God forbid!-	
OXFORD. Women and children of so high a courage,	
QUEEN MARGARET. Thanks, gentle Somerset; sweet Oxford, thanks.	
OXFORD. Here pitch our battle; hence we will not budge.	
QUEEN MARGARET. Lords, knights, and gentlemen, what I should say	
His realm a slaughter-house, his subjects slain,	
	
KING EDWARD. Now here a period of tumultuous broils.	
KING EDWARD. Is proclamation made that who finds Edward	
GLOUCESTER. It is; and lo where youthful Edward comes.	
QUEEN MARGARET. Ay, thou wast born to be a plague to men.	
PRINCE OF WALES. I know my duty; you are all undutiful.	
Lascivious Edward, and thou perjur'd George,	
CLARENCE. And there's for twitting me with perjury.	
QUEEN MARGARET. O, kill me too!	
But if you ever chance to have a child,	
Here sheathe thy sword; I'll pardon thee my death.	
Exit, led out forcibly	
Have now the fatal object in my eye	
And yet, for all his wings, the fool was drown'd.	
Ah, kill me with thy weapon, not with words!	
My breast can better brook thy dagger's point	
Thou hadst not liv'd to kill a son of mine.	
Orphans for their parents' timeless death-	
To wit, an indigest deformed lump,	
To signify thou cam'st to bite the world;	
KING HENRY. Ay, and for much more slaughter after this.	
I, that have neither pity, love, nor fear.	
And seek their ruin that usurp'd our right?	
Clarence, beware; thou keep'st me from the light,	
For I will buzz abroad such prophecies	
HASTINGS, NURSE, with the Young PRINCE, and attendants	
KING EDWARD. Once more we sit in England's royal throne,	
Young Ned, for thee thine uncles and myself	
[Aside] To say the truth, so Judas kiss'd his master	
And cried 'All hail!' when as he meant all harm.

And hither have they sent it for her ransom.

May here find truth too. Those that come to see

They shall abound as formerly.	
For this great journey. What did this vanity

Under pretence to see the Queen his aunt-

Something mistaken in't.	
Of Hereford, Stafford, and Northampton, I	
To see you ta'en from liberty, to look on	
Of the Duke's confessor, John de la Car,	
Of a full-charg'd confederacy, and give thanks	
I'll hear his confessions justify;	
He shall again relate.	
That you would love yourself, and in that love	
Not unconsidered leave your honour nor	
The dignity of your office, is the point	
The clothiers all, not able to maintain	
Unfit for other life, compell'd by hunger	
And lack of other means, in desperate manner	
Too hard an exclamation.	
WOLSEY. And for me,	
I have no further gone in this than by	
That virtue must go through. We must not stint	
As rav'nous fishes do a vessel follow	
State-statues only.	
A trembling contribution! Why, we take	
I put it to your care.	
Of the King's grace and pardon. The grieved commons

Most like a careful subject, have collected	
It would infect his speech-that if the King

The faith they have in tennis, and tall stockings,

CHAMBERLAIN. Sir Thomas,	
LOVELL. To the Cardinal's;	
LOVELL. That churchman bears a bounteous mind indeed,	
His dews fall everywhere.	
He had a black mouth that said other of him.	
Sparing would show a worse sin than ill doctrine:	
But few now give so great ones. My barge stays;	
	
GENTLEMEN, as guests, at one door; at another door enter SIR HENRY	
As, first, good company, good wine, good welcome,

SANDYS. Your Grace is noble.	
SANDYS. The red wine first must rise

Exit CHAMBERLAIN attended. All rise, and tables remov'd

I fear, with dancing is a little heated.	
Who's best in favour. Let the music knock it.	
Exeunt, with trumpets	
That labour, sir. All's now done but the ceremony	
Came to the bar; where to his accusations	
He never was so womanish; the cause	
FIRST GENTLEMAN. 'Tis likely,	
And far enough from court too.	
Wish him ten fathom deep: this Duke as much

There cannot be those numberless offences	
Shall cry for blessings on him. May he live	
Longer than I have time to tell his years;

And with that blood will make 'em one day groan fort.	
Made my name once more noble. Now his son,	
The least rub in your fortunes, fall away	
Speak how I fell. I have done; and God forgive me!	
'Tis full of woe; yet I can give you inkling	
I do not talk much.	
Between the King and Katharine?	
We are too open here to argue this;	
	
When they were ready to set out for London, a man of	
	
SUFFOLK. Pray God he do! He'll never know himself else.	
Between us and the Emperor, the Queen's great nephew,	
CHAMBERLAIN. Heaven keep me from such counsel! 'Tis most true	
And every true heart weeps for 't. All that dare	
Look into these affairs see this main end-	
SUFFOLK. And free us from his slavery.	
As I am made without him, so I'll stand,	
If the King please; his curses and his blessings	
Touch me alike; th' are breath I not believe in.	
CHAMBERLAIN. Excuse me,	
SUFFOLK. How sad he looks; sure, he is much afflicted.	
Malice ne'er meant. Our breach of duty this way	
KING. Ye are too bold.	
Go to; I'll make ye know your times of business.	
Is this an hour for temporal affairs, ha?	
Have their free voices. Rome the nurse of judgment,	
You are so noble. To your Highness' hand	
KING. Two equal men. The Queen shall be acquainted	
In this man's place before him?	
Kept him a foreign man still; which so griev'd him	
If I command him, follows my appointment.	
So many courses of the sun enthroned,	
Would move a monster.	
Yet, if that quarrel, fortune, do divorce	
If you might please to stretch it.	
ANNE. No, in truth.	
I swear again I would not be a queen	
Our mistress' sorrows we were pitying.	
The action of good women; there is hope	
More worth than empty vanities; yet prayers and wishes	
ANNE. My honour'd lord!                       Exit LORD CHAMBERLAIN	
Come pat betwixt too early and too late	
I know your back will bear a duchess. Say,	
ANNE. Good lady,	
ROCHESTER, and SAINT ASAPH; next them, with some small distance,

CARDINALS sit under him as judges. The QUEEN takes place some distance	
And on all sides th' authority allow'd;

Your pleasure be fulfill'd!	
Of singular integrity and learning,	
To plead your cause. It shall be therefore bootless	
WOLSEY. Your pleasure, madam?	
Refuse you for my judge, whom yet once more	
That I have blown this coal: I do deny it.	
I am not of your wrong. Therefore in him	
I am a simple woman, much too weak	
Where pow'rs are your retainers, and your words,	
And to be judg'd by him.	
KING. Go thy ways, Kate.	
WOLSEY. Most gracious sir,	
Or touch of her good person?

I mean the Bishop-did require a respite	
Wherein he might the King his lord advertise	
I meant to rectify my conscience, which	
I then did feel full sick, and yet not well,	
By all the reverend fathers of the land	
The daring'st counsel which I had to doubt,	
KING. I then mov'd you,	
Of the good Queen, but the sharp thorny points	
To wear our moral state to come with her,	
The Queen being absent, 'tis a needful fitness	
Meanwhile must be an earnest motion	
This dilatory sloth and tricks of Rome.	
SONG	
They should be good men, their affairs as righteous;	
	
There's nothing I have done yet, o' my conscience,	
Deserves a corner. Would all other women	
Could speak this with as free a soul as I do!	
Pray speak in English. Here are some will thank you,	
Believe me, she has had much wrong. Lord Cardinal,	
So deep suspicion, where all faith was meant	
Like free and honest men, our just opinions	
And to such men of gravity and learning,	
Alas, I am a woman, friendless, hopeless!	
WOLSEY. Madam, you wrong the King's love with these fears;	
Though he be grown so desperate to be honest-	
And live a subject? Nay, forsooth, my friends,	
In mine own country, lords.	
But cardinal sins and hollow hearts I fear ye.	
If you have any justice, any pity,	
If ye be any thing but churchmen's habits-	
One that ne'er dream'd a joy beyond his pleasure,	
WOLSEY. Madam, you wander from the good we aim at.	
Shipwreck'd upon a kingdom, where no pity,	
Grow from the King's acquaintance, by this carriage.

Where's your commission, lords? Words cannot carry

Have burnt that tongue than said so.	
With thee and all thy best parts bound together,	
That in the way of loyalty and truth	
And from this fellow? If we live thus tamely,	
SURREY. Yes, that goodness

SURREY. I had rather want those than my head. Have at you!	
Of all the kingdom. Many more there are,

A great man should decline? Nay, an you weep,

I humbly thank his Grace; and from these shoulders,

With maiden flowers, that all the world may know

ROBERT. The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge.	
BASTARD. Most certain of one mother, mighty king-	
That is my brother's plea, and none of mine;	
That still I lay upon my mother's head;	
Compare our faces and be judge yourself.	
ROBERT. And once dispatch'd him in an embassy	
And if my legs were two such riding-rods,	
KING JOHN. What is thy name?	
ELINOR. The very spirit of Plantagenet!	
'Tis too respective and too sociable	
It draws toward supper in conclusion so.	
Exterior form, outward accoutrement,	
That will take pains to blow a horn before her?	
LADY FAULCONBRIDGE. Where is that slave, thy brother?	
BASTARD. My brother Robert, old Sir Robert's son?	
GURNEY. Good leave, good Philip.	
What! I am dubb'd; I have it on my shoulder.	
And so doth yours: your fault was not your folly;	
The aweless lion could not wage the fight	
Who lives and dares but say thou didst not well	
Enter, on one side, AUSTRIA and forces; on the other, KING PHILIP OF	
At our importance hither is he come	
KING PHILIP. A noble boy! Who would not do thee right?	
AUSTRIA. Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss	
Till Angiers and the right thou hast in France,	
Even till that utmost corner of the west	
To make a more requital to your love!	
Against the brows of this resisting town;	
Lest unadvis'd you stain your swords with blood;	
And then we shall repent each drop of blood	
	
An Ate, stirring him to blood and strife;	
KING PHILIP. How much unlook'd for is this expedition!	
Let them be welcome then; we are prepar'd.	
PEMBROKE, and others	
KING JOHN. Peace be to France, if France in peace permit	
England we love, and for that England's sake	
That thou hast under-wrought his lawful king,	
ELINOR. Who is it thou dost call usurper, France?	
ELINOR. Out, insolent! Thy bastard shall be king,	
His father never was so true begot;	
AUSTRIA. What the devil art thou?	
Or lay on that shall make your shoulders crack.	
Arthur of Britaine, yield thee to my hand,	
ELINOR. Come to thy grandam, child.	
ELINOR. His mother shames him so, poor boy, he weeps.	
But God hath made her sin and her the plague	
To make a faithless error in your cars;	
In the relief of this oppressed child	
With unhack'd swords and helmets all unbruis'd,	
And leave your children, wives, and you, in peace.	
In that behalf which we have challeng'd it;	
Or shall we give the signal to our rage,	
For him, and in his right, we hold this town.	
KING JOHN. Acknowledge then the King, and let me in.	
KING JOHN. Then God forgive the sin of all those souls	
That to their everlasting residence,	
AUSTRIA. Peace! no more.	
KING PHILIP. It shall be so; and at the other hill	
And let young Arthur, Duke of Britaine, in,	
Many a widow's husband grovelling lies,	
To enter conquerors, and to proclaim	
	
That did display them when we first march'd forth;	
Strength match'd with strength, and power confronted power;	
	
That sways the earth this climate overlooks,	
When the rich blood of kings is set on fire!	
KING PHILIP. Let it be so. Say, where will you assault?	
KING JOHN. Speak on with favour; we are bent to hear.	
Of Lewis the Dauphin and that lovely maid.	
Where should he find it fairer than in Blanch?	
If love ambitious sought a match of birth,	
He is the half part of a blessed man,	
With swifter spleen than powder can enforce,	
And give you entrance; but without this match,	
More free from motion-no, not Death himself	
As we to keep this city.	
As maids of thirteen do of puppy-dogs!	
Zounds! I was never so bethump'd with words	
I see a yielding in the looks of France;	
KING JOHN. If that the Dauphin there, thy princely son,	
In titles, honours, and promotions,	
Further I will not flatter you, my lord,	
Full thirty thousand marks of English coin.	
Philip of France, if thou be pleas'd withal,	
Yet in some measure satisfy her so	
To this unlook'd-for, unprepared pomp.	
Whom zeal and charity brought to the field	
The world, who of itself is peised well,	
Well, whiles I am a beggar, I will rail	
To say there is no vice but beggary.	
It is not so; thou hast misspoke, misheard;	
A woman, naturally born to fears;	
But they will quake and tremble all this day.	
What means that hand upon that breast of thine?	
CONSTANCE. O, if thou teach me to believe this sorrow,	
To tread down fair respect of sovereignty,	
Am bound to under-bear.	
SALISBURY. Pardon me, madam,	
Let kings assemble; for my grief's so great	
Shall never see it but a holiday.	
Nay, rather turn this day out of the week,	
To curse the fair proceedings of this day.	
Thou little valiant, great in villainy!	
PANDULPH. Hail, you anointed deputies of heaven!	
Tell him this tale, and from the mouth of England	
So tell the Pope, all reverence set apart	
This juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish;	
Yet I alone, alone do me oppose	
Against the Pope, and count his friends my foes.	
And blessed shall he be that doth revolt	
And meritorious shall that hand be call'd,	
To my keen curses; for without my wrong	
There is no tongue hath power to curse him right.	
AUSTRIA. Well, ruffian, I must pocket up these wrongs,	
In likeness of a new untrimmed bride.	
CONSTANCE. O be remov'd from him, and answer well!	
With slaughter's pencil, where revenge did paint	
Of smiling peace to march a bloody host,	
And make a riot on the gentle brow	
To do your pleasure, and continue friends.	
Save what is opposite to England's love.	
Therefore, to arms! be champion of our church,	
Than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold.	
KING PHILIP. I may disjoin my hand, but not my faith.	
Is not amiss when it is truly done;	
If thou vouchsafe them. But if not, then know	
Upon my knee I beg, go not to arms	
France, I am burn'd up with inflaming wrath,	
Exeunt severally

BASTARD. Now, by my life, this day grows wondrous hot;	
	
BASTARD. My lord, I rescued her;	
Must by the hungry now be fed upon.	
Attended with the pleasures of the world,	
Or if that surly spirit, melancholy,	
Then, in despite of brooded watchful day,	
Though that my death were adjunct to my act,

Enter KING PHILIP, LEWIS, PANDULPH, and attendants	
Is scattered and disjoin'd from fellowship.	
Of any kindred action like to this?	
Look who comes here! a grave unto a soul;	
Thou hate and terror to prosperity,	
Come, grin on me, and I will think thou smil'st,	
Or madly think a babe of clouts were he.	
Do glue themselves in sociable grief,	
Must I behold my pretty Arthur more.	
Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form;	
And bitter shame hath spoil'd the sweet world's taste,	
A sceptre snatch'd with an unruly hand	
Out of the bloody fingers' ends of john.	
Go with me to the King. 'Tis wonderful	
He will awake my mercy, which lies dead;	
Out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears.-	
Can you not read it? Is it not fair writ?	
And I did never ask it you again;	
And ne'er have spoke a loving word to you;	
But you at your sick service had a prince.	
So much as frown on you?	
ARTHUR. Ah, none but in this iron age would do it!	
Nay, after that, consume away in rust	
HUBERT. Give me the iron, I say, and bind him here.	
ARTHUR. Is there no remedy?	
A grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair,	
Then, feeling what small things are boisterous there,	
So I may keep mine eyes. O, spare mine eyes,	
And would not harm me.	
HUBERT. Silence; no more. Go closely in with me.	
SCENE 2.	
And that high royalty was ne'er pluck'd off,	
PEMBROKE. But that your royal pleasure must be done,	
PEMBROKE. When workmen strive to do better than well,	
Doth make the fault the worse by th' excuse,	
KING JOHN. Let it be so. I do commit his youth	
Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his	
Like heralds 'twixt two dreadful battles set.	
Good lords, although my will to give is living,	
PEMBROKE. Indeed, we heard how near his death he was,	
That blood which ow'd the breadth of all this isle	
	
That I have seen inhabit in those cheeks?	
So foul a sky clears not without a storm.	
For when you should be told they do prepare,	
Your noble mother; and as I hear, my lord,	
To any tongue, speak it of what it will.	
Deliver him to safety; and return,	
Of Arthur, whom they say is kill'd to-night	
On your suggestion.	
BASTARD. The spirit of the time shall teach me speed.	
Why urgest thou so oft young Arthur's death?	
HUBERT. Here is your hand and seal for what I did.	
This murder had not come into my mind;	
KING JOHN. Hadst thou but shook thy head or made pause,	
And didst in signs again parley with sin;	
I'll make a peace between your soul and you.	
	
	
	
Doth lay it open to urge on revenge.	
BIGOT. Or, when he doom'd this beauty to a grave,	
Form such another? This is the very top,	
And prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest,	
If that it be the work of any hand.	
It is the shameful work of Hubert's hand;	
Arthur doth live; the King hath sent for you.	
That you shall think the devil is come from hell.	
BASTARD. Here's a good world! Knew you of this fair work?	
BASTARD. Ha! I'll tell thee what:	
And if thou want'st a cord, the smallest thread	
Will serve to strangle thee; a rush will be a beam	
And it shall be as all the ocean,	
Enough to stifle such a villain up	
HUBERT. If I in act, consent, or sin of thought,	
Be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath	
BASTARD. Go, bear him in thine arms.	
How easy dost thou take all England up!	
Is fled to heaven; and England now is left	
	
That present med'cine must be minist'red	
But Dover Castle. London hath receiv'd,	
The little number of your doubtful friends.	
But wherefore do you droop? Why look you sad?	
Be stirring as the time; be fire with fire;	
Threaten the threat'ner, and outface the brow	
Show boldness and aspiring confidence.	
A cock'red silken wanton, brave our fields	
Enter, in arms, LEWIS, SALISBURY, MELUN, PEMBROKE, BIGOT, and soldiers	
	
LEWIS. My Lord Melun, let this be copied out	
The great metropolis and see of Rome.	
LEWIS. Your Grace shall pardon me, I will not back:	
Or useful serving-man and instrument	
To any sovereign state throughout the world.	
Because that John hath made his peace with Rome?	
That undergo this charge? Who else but I,	
I come, to learn how you have dealt for him;	
The youth says well. Now hear our English King;	
He is prepar'd, and reason too he should.	
This harness'd masque and unadvised revel	
That in your chambers gave you chastisement?	
Strike up the drums; and let the tongue of war,	
And mock the deep-mouth'd thunder; for at hand-	
	
And welcome home again discarded faith.	
Which bleeds away even as a form of wax	
Since I must lose the use of all deceit?	
That I must die here, and live hence by truth?	
Stoop low within those bounds we have o'erlook'd,	
	
	
LEWIS. keep good quarter and good care to-night;	
HUBERT. Who's there? Speak, ho! speak quickly, or I shoot.	
HUBERT. Of the part of England.	
Thou mayst befriend me so much as to think	
And tempt us not to bear above our power!	
The orchard at Swinstead Abbey	
Doth by the idle comments that it makes	
PRINCE HENRY. Let him be brought into the orchard here.	
And so ingrateful you deny me that.	
PRINCE HENRY. O that there were some virtue in my tears,	
	
My heart hath one poor string to stay it by,	
BASTARD. The Dauphin is preparing hitherward,	
Devoured by the unexpected flood.                 [The KING dies]	
My liege! my lord! But now a king-now thus.	
SALISBURY. It seems you know not, then, so much as we:	
To the disposing of the Cardinal;	
BASTARD. Thither shall it, then;	
Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror,	
But when it first did help to wound itself.	
	
	
Scene III. Within the tent of Brutus.	
	
	
MARULLUS.	
cobbler.	
MARULLUS.	
A trade, sir, that I hope I may use with a safe conscience, which is

FLAVIUS.

handiwork.	
	
What tributaries follow him to Rome,	
To towers and windows, yea, to chimney tops,	
And do you now strew flowers in his way,	
SCENE II. The same. A public place.	
	
CAESAR.	
CASCA.	
CAESAR.	
	
	
SOOTHSAYER.	
Bid every noise be still; peace yet again!	
Beware the Ides of March.	
Will you go see the order of the course?	
Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;	
I’ll leave you.	
Your hidden worthiness into your eye,	
(Except immortal Caesar) speaking of Brutus,	
BRUTUS.	
For that which is not in me?	
That I profess myself in banqueting,	
Ay, do you fear it?	
Did I the tired Caesar. And this man	
How he did shake: ’tis true, this god did shake:	
	
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,	
Write them together, yours is as fair a name;	
As easily as a king!	
I shall recount hereafter. For this present,	
	
I am glad that my weak words	
Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.	
ANTONY.	
And therefore are they very dangerous.	
Ay, Casca, tell us what hath chanc’d today,	
Why, you were with him, were you not?	
CASCA.	
Why, Antony.	
	
CASCA.	
	
	
BRUTUS.	
CASCA.	
CASSIUS.	
put to silence. Fare you well. There was more foolery yet, if I could	
CASCA.	
Have riv’d the knotty oaks; and I have seen	
To be exalted with the threatening clouds:	
Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.	
Transformed with their fear; who swore they saw	
“These are their reasons; they are natural”;	
Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow?	
Send word to you he would be there tomorrow.	
Goodnight then, Casca: this disturbed sky	
CASCA.	
Farewell, Cicero.	
Enter Cassius.	
CASSIUS.	
CASSIUS.	
CASCA.	
But wherefore did you so much tempt the Heavens?	
When the most mighty gods by tokens send	
That Heaven hath infus’d them with these spirits,	
That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars,	
And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.	
So every bondman in his own hand bears	
Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf,	
You speak to Casca, and to such a man	
Repair to Pompey’s Porch, where you shall find us.	
To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie,	
	
See Brutus at his house: three parts of him	
	
His countenance, like richest alchemy,	
Will change to virtue and to worthiness.	
	
What, Lucius, ho!	
How that might change his nature, there’s the question.	
By which he did ascend. So Caesar may;	
	
	
This is Trebonius.	
	
CASSIUS.	
	
Here, as I point my sword, the Sun arises;	
Stands, as the Capitol, directly here.	
	
What need we any spur but our own cause	
That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear	
I think he will stand very strong with us.	
	
CASCA.	
Indeed, he is not fit.	
DECIUS.	
	
Should outlive Caesar: we shall find of him	
Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds.	
We shall be call’d purgers, not murderers.	
To sports, to wildness, and much company.	
Of fantasy, of dreams, and ceremonies.	
And I will bring him to the Capitol.	
	
CASSIUS.	
Let not our looks put on our purposes,	
Enter Portia.	
	
And when I ask’d you what the matter was,	
Yet I insisted, yet you answer’d not,	
Gave sign for me to leave you. So I did,	
Fearing to strengthen that impatience	
It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep;	
BRUTUS.	
I am not well in health, and that is all.	
PORTIA.	
BRUTUS.	
Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.	
To walk unbraced and suck up the humours	
And will he steal out of his wholesome bed	
But, as it were, in sort or limitation,	
Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose ’em.	
Leave me with haste.	
Enter Lucius with Ligarius.	
Boy, stand aside. Caius Ligarius, how?	
To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!	
Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,	
I here discard my sickness. Soul of Rome!	
	
That must we also. What it is, my Caius,	
	
Thrice hath Calphurnia in her sleep cried out,	
And bring me their opinions of success.	
I will, my lord.	
You shall not stir out of your house today.	
Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.	
The noise of battle hurtled in the air,	
CAESAR.	
The valiant never taste of death but once.	
It seems to me most strange that men should fear,	
Enter Servant.	
	
They would not have you to stir forth today.	
	
Mark Antony shall say I am not well,	
Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck	
	
I am ashamed I did yield to them.	
Good morrow, Casca. Caius Ligarius,	
As that same ague which hath made you lean.	
So to most noble Caesar.	
Bid them prepare within.	
Be near me, that I may remember you.	
is but one mind in all these men, and it is bent against Caesar. If	
thou be’st not immortal, look about you: security gives way to	
[_Aside._] O constancy, be strong upon my side,	
I have a man’s mind, but a woman’s might.	
	
	
PORTIA.	
PORTIA.	
Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?	
To be so good to Caesar as to hear me,	
PORTIA.	
Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;	
[_Exeunt._]	
Soothsayer.	
DECIUS.	
Trebonius doth desire you to o’er-read,	
Caesar enters the Capitol, the rest following. All the Senators rise.	
[_Advances to Caesar._]	
CASSIUS.	
He wish’d today our enterprise might thrive.	
Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known,	
DECIUS.	
That Caesar and his Senate must redress?	
	
METELLUS.	
[_Kneeling._]	
I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar;	
	
	
[_Casca stabs Caesar in the neck. Caesar catches hold of his arm. He	
	
	
“Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement!”	
Should chance—	
	
Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run,	
As it were doomsday.	
BRUTUS.	
	
	
DECIUS.	
	
	
Soft, who comes here? A friend of Antony’s.	
And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say:	
If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony	
How Caesar hath deserv’d to lie in death,	
I wish we may: but yet have I a mind	
	
Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,	
As fire drives out fire, so pity pity—	
Your voice shall be as strong as any man’s	
And then we will deliver you the cause	
That I did love thee, Caesar, O, ’tis true:	
Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,	
Most noble, in the presence of thy corse?	
It would become me better than to close	
In terms of friendship with thine enemies.	
	
CASSIUS.	
	
By that which he will utter?	
	
ANTONY.	
To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue,	
With carrion men, groaning for burial.	
You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?	
	
	
	
Hie hence, and tell him so. Yet stay awhile;	
To young Octavius of the state of things.	
SECOND CITIZEN.	
Then none have I offended. I have done no more to Caesar than you shall	
CITIZENS.	
FIRST CITIZEN.	
Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.	
	
	
ANTONY.	
[_Goes up._]	
	
You gentle Romans,—	
Hath told you Caesar was ambitious.	
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:	
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;	
THIRD CITIZEN.	
But yesterday the word of Caesar might	
And, dying, mention it within their wills,	
It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.	
Descend.	
You all do know this mantle. I remember	
O traitors, villains!	
SECOND CITIZEN.	
	
Stay, countrymen.	
I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts.	
That gave me public leave to speak of him.	
The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.	
	
	
THIRD CITIZEN.	
Never, never. Come, away, away!	
Go, fetch fire.	
	
How now, fellow?	
	
And in this mood will give us anything.	
SERVANT.	
How I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius.	
	
That’s as much as to say they are fools that marry; you’ll bear me a	
FIRST CITIZEN.	
	
Tear him to pieces! He’s a conspirator.	
FOURTH CITIZEN.	
	
Or here, or at the Capitol.	
Meet to be sent on errands. Is it fit,	
	
So is my horse, Octavius; and for that	
A barren-spirited fellow; one that feeds	
And open perils surest answered.	
BRUTUS.	
In his own change, or by ill officers,	
Sink in the trial. Comes his army on?	
	
Judge me, you gods; wrong I mine enemies?	
CASSIUS.	
Cassius, be content.	
Come to our tent till we have done our conference.	
You wrong’d yourself to write in such a case.	
	
That every nice offence should bear his comment.	
	
I an itching palm!	
Chastisement!	
Remember March, the Ides of March remember:	
Contaminate our fingers with base bribes,	
I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,	
Older in practice, abler than yourself	
	
	
Hear me, for I will speak.	
Go show your slaves how choleric you are,	
BRUTUS.	
And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring	
You love me not.	
BRUTUS.	
CASSIUS.	
And here my naked breast; within, a heart	
	
LUCILIUS.	
Ha, ha! How vilely doth this cynic rhyme!	
[_Exeunt Lucilius and Titinius._]	
BRUTUS.	
	
CASSIUS.	
And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony	
O ye immortal gods!	
Enter Lucius, with wine and a taper.	
In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius.	
	
[_Drinks._]	
	
[_Drinks._]	
Have put to death an hundred Senators.	
	
Of marching to Philippi presently?	
	
Are full of rest, defence, and nimbleness.	
Do stand but in a forced affection;	
Come on refresh’d, new-added, and encourag’d;	
	
	
Farewell now, good Messala.	
CASSIUS.	
	
	
LUCIUS.	
Poor knave, I blame thee not, thou art o’er-watch’d.	
	
It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.	
	
[_Servants lie down._]	
Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn’d down	
	
GHOST.	
	
BRUTUS.	
	
Why, I will see thee at Philippi then.	
Lucius, awake!	
BRUTUS.	
	
	
BRUTUS.	
And we will follow.	
	
With fearful bravery, thinking by this face	
But ’tis not so.	
Prepare you, generals.	
	
	
BRUTUS.	
Stand fast, Titinius; we must out and talk.	
	
	
CASSIUS.	
	
ANTONY.	
Villains, you did not so when your vile daggers	
Hack’d one another in the sides of Caesar:	
And bow’d like bondmen, kissing Caesar’s feet;	
Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth.	
CASSIUS.	
And his opinion. Now I change my mind,	
Gorging and feeding from our soldiers’ hands,	
Now, most noble Brutus,	
For fear of what might fall, so to prevent	
CASSIUS.	
No, Cassius, no: think not, thou noble Roman,	
	
	
Unto the legions on the other side.	
	
	
	
Enter Pindarus.	
Fly, therefore, noble Cassius, fly far off.	
Titinius, if thou lovest me,	
Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops	
Whether yond troops are friend or enemy.	
CASSIUS.	
What news?	
	
He’s ta’en!	
CASSIUS.	
	
That ran through Caesar’s bowels, search this bosom.	
Durst I have done my will. O Cassius!	
Enter Titinius with Messala.	
As Cassius’ legions are by Antony.	
These tidings would well comfort Cassius.	
TITINIUS.	
MESSALA.	
Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men	
What, Pindarus! where art thou, Pindarus?	
TITINIUS.	
Hie you, Messala,	
And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?	
But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;	
Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I	
Come, Cassius’ sword, and find Titinius’ heart.	
	
BRUTUS.	
I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.	
Come therefore, and to Thassos send his body.	
A foe to tyrants, and my country’s friend.	
There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight;	
	
	
I dare assure thee that no enemy	
This is not Brutus, friend; but, I assure you,	
	
Statilius show’d the torch-light; but, my lord,	
It is a deed in fashion. Hark thee, Clitus.	
	
What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.	
	
Why, this, Volumnius:	
Not so, my lord.	
I found no man but he was true to me.	
CLITUS.	
Fly, my lord, fly!	
	
How died my master, Strato?	
	
According to his virtue let us use him	
Within my tent his bones tonight shall lie,

By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn	
To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.	
At large discourse while here they do remain.	
Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby,	
Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.

As if the cause were his.	
I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;	
CASSIO. Madam, not now. I am very ill at ease,	
Seeing you coming.	
OTHELLO.             I do believe 'twas he.	
A man that languishes in your displeasure.	
If I have any grace or power to move you,	
DESDEMONA. Ay, sooth; so humbled	
To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.	
Save that, they say, the wars must make example	
Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,	
Know of your love?	
OTHELLO. Indeed? ay, indeed. Discern'st thou aught in that?	
And when I told thee he was of my counsel	
Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more;	
I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,	
IAGO.                 Good my lord, pardon me;	
If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear	
IAGO.                         I do beseech you-	
As, I confess, it is my nature's plague	
IAGO. Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,	
To follow still the changes of the moon	
With franker spirit. Therefore, as I am bound,	
Is not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown.	
She loved them most.	
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon	
Than to suspicion.	
IAGO.                Should you do so, my lord,	
My speech should fall into such vile success	
OTHELLO. Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless	
You shall by that perceive him and his means.	
To prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black	
Prerogatived are they less than the base;	
I'll not believe't.	
He puts the handkerchief from him, and she drops it.	
Let it alone. Come, I'll go in with you.	
For that same handkerchief?	
When she shall lack it.	
Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,	
OTHELLO.                       Ha, ha, false to me?	
IAGO. Why, how now, general! No more of that.	
The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,	
Farewell! Othello's occupation's gone!	
Poison or fire, or suffocating streams,	
You would be satisfied?	
Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on?	
One of this kind is Cassio.	
Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief	
Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?	
IAGO. If it be that, or any that was hers,	
Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love,	
And to obey shall be in me remorse,	
What bloody business ever.                             They rise.

DESDEMONA. In sooth, you are to blame.	
They eat us hungerly, and when they are full	
	
But to know so must be my benefit;	
Than for myself I dare. Let that suffice you.	
I was, unhandsome warrior as I am,	
But jealous for they are jealous. 'Tis a monster	
CASSIO.              Pardon me, Bianca.	
Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth,	
As like enough it will- I'ld have it copied.	
BIANCA. Leave you! wherefore?	
BIANCA.                       Why, I pray you?	
IAGO. Will you think so?	
Or heard him say- as knaves be such abroad,	
IAGO. Faith, that he did- I know not what he did.	
This is his second fit; he had one yesterday.	
IAGO.                              No, forbear;	
For I will make him tell the tale anew,	
Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen,	
Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?	
CASSIO.                         Alas, poor caitiff!	
OTHELLO. Look, how he laughs already!	
to my wit; do not think it so unwholesome. Ha, ha, ha!	
CASSIO. Well, I must leave her company.	
	
OTHELLO. [Advancing.] How shall I murther him, Iago?	
IAGO. And did you see the handkerchief?	
OTHELLO. Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned tonight, for	
out of a bear. Of so high and plenteous wit and invention-	
LODOVICO. God save the worthy general!	
Welcome to Cyprus.	
OTHELLO. Are you sure of that?	
LODOVICO. He did not call; he's busy in the paper.	
OTHELLO. Devil!                                        Strikes her.	
LODOVICO.                              Who, I, my lord?	
EMILIA. Never, my lord.	
Is foul as slander.	
She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd	
That cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore,	
DESDEMONA. What is your pleasure?	
OTHELLO. Come, swear it, damn thyself;	
Should fear to seize thee. Therefore be double-damn'd;	
A fixed figure for the time of scorn	
But there, where I have garner'd up my heart,	
To knot and gender in! Turn thy complexion there,	
OTHELLO. Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,	
	
We have done our course; there's money for your pains.	
EMILIA. Why, with my lord, madam.	
DESDEMONA. Who is thy lord?	
But what should go by water. Prithee, tonight	
The small'st opinion on my least misuse?	
DESDEMONA. Am I that name, Iago?	
DESDEMONA. I do not know; I am sure I am none such.	
Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.	
IAGO.                             Speak within door.	
Good friend, go to him, for by this light of heaven,	
If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love	
To do the act that might the addition earn	
Go in, and weep not; all things shall be well.

fair Desdemona, unless his abode be lingered here by some	
accident; wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of	
it on him. It is now high supper-time, and the night grows to	
IAGO. And you shall be satisfied.                           Exeunt.	
LODOVICO. Madam, good night; I humbly thank your ladyship.	
DESDEMONA. It was his bidding; therefore, good Emilia,	
We must not now displease him.	
DESDEMONA. So would not I. My love doth so approve him,	
If I do die before thee, prithee shroud me	
This Lodovico is a proper man.	
Prithee, hie thee; he'll come anon-	
That there be women do abuse their husbands	
DESDEMONA. Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?	
i' the dark.	
DESDEMONA.          In troth, I think thou wouldst not.	
For the whole world.	
Their wives have sense like them; they see and smell	
Quick, quick; fear nothing; I'll be at thy elbow.	
IAGO. I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense,	
He calls me to a restitution large	
It must not be. If Cassio do remain,	
OTHELLO. The voice of Cassio; Iago keeps his word.	
Forth of my heart those charms, thine eyes, are blotted;	
Exit.	
Enter Lodovico and Gratiano.	
IAGO.                                       What's the matter?	
IAGO. What are you here that cry so grievously?	
IAGO. O me, lieutenant! What villains have done this?	
IAGO. I cry you mercy. Here's Cassio hurt by villains.	
	
IAGO. Who is't that cried?	
CASSIO. No.	
Alas, my friend and my dear countryman	
Roderigo? No- yes, sure. O heaven! Roderigo.	
What, do you shake at that?	
IAGO. Kind gentlemen, let's go see poor Cassio dress'd.	
Will you go on? [Aside.] This is the night	
O, balmy breath, that dost almost persuade	
Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee,	
DESDEMONA. Who's there? Othello?	
Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace,	
DESDEMONA. Alas, my lord, what may you mean by that?	
No, heaven forfend! I would not kill thy soul.	
Since guiltiness I know not; but yet I feel I fear.	
OTHELLO. Ay, and for that thou diest.	
DESDEMONA. I will so. What's the matter?	
And makest me call what I intend to do	
DESDEMONA.                He found it then;	
DESDEMONA.                       How? unlawfully?	
Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't.	
DESDEMONA. Alas, he is betray'd, and I undone!	
Still as the grave. Shall she come in? were't good?	
OTHELLO. What, now?	
EMILIA. Cassio, my lord, hath kill'd a young Venetian	
And Cassio kill'd?	
OTHELLO. That? what?	
OTHELLO. You heard her say herself, it was not I.	
EMILIA. She said so; I must needs report the truth.	
EMILIA. Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.	
OTHELLO. She was false as water.	
EMILIA. That she was false to wedlock?	
Rot half a grain a day! He lies to the heart.	
OTHELLO. Ha!	
As ignorant as dirt! Thou hast done a deed-	
EMILIA. Disprove this villain, if thou be'st a man.	
I know thou didst not, thou'rt not such a villain.	
IAGO. I told him what I thought, and told no more	
Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie!	
My mistress here lies murther'd in her bed-	
O villainy, villainy!	
IAGO. Be wise, and get you home.	
I found by fortune and did give my husband,	
IAGO.                          Villainous whore!	
And I did give't my husband.	
Let it go all.	
It is a sword of Spain, the ice-brook's temper-	
And he retires. Where should Othello go?	
Pale as thy smock! When we shall meet at compt,	
LODOVICO. Wrench his sword from him.	
GRATIANO.                    Torments will ope your lips.	
OTHELLO. Well, thou dost best.	
Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo,	
OTHELLO. O villain!	
Iago set him on.	
Nor set down aught in malice. Then must you speak	
Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes,	
Albeit unused to the melting mood,	
OTHELLO. I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee. No way but this,	
Look on the tragic loading of this bed;

SCENE: Dispersedly in various countries.	
On ember-eves and holy-ales;

To evil should be done by none:

Music. Enter the Daughter of Antiochus.	
	
Her countless glory, which desert must gain;	
Presumes to reach, all the whole heap must die.	
I’ll make my will then, and, as sick men do	
Gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did;	
	
	
I mother, wife, and yet his child.	
If this be true, which makes me pale to read it?	
	
	
For he’s no man on whom perfections wait	
Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime.	
For that’s an article within our law,	
For vice repeated is like the wandering wind,	
Blows dust in others’ eyes, to spread itself;	
Copp’d hills towards heaven, to tell the earth is throng’d	
Then give my tongue like leave to love my head.	
[_Aside_] Heaven, that I had thy head! He has found the meaning:	
When what is done is like an hypocrite,	
By flight I’ll shun the danger which I fear.	
	
For which we mean to have his head.

Doth your highness call?

Sit down: thou art no flatterer:	
Fit counsellor and servant for a prince,	
Thou speak’st like a physician, Helicanus,	
That ministers a potion unto me	
Are arms to princes, and bring joys to subjects.	
Which fear so grew in me I hither fled,	
That I should open to the listening air	
And make pretence of wrong that I have done him;	
Must feel war’s blow, who spares not innocence:	
	
If further yet you will be satisfied,	
THALIARD.	
To show his sorrow, he’d correct himself;	
My message must return from whence it came.

That were to blow at fire in hope to quench it;	
Throws down one mountain to cast up a higher.	
Our tongues and sorrows do sound deep	
Were all too little to content and please,

Expect even here, where is a kingly patient:	
	
[_Marina sings._]	
LYSIMACHUS.	
	
My lord, that ne’er before invited eyes,	
[_Aside._] I will desist;	
	
	
	
So indeed I did.	
Did warrant me was likely.	
Like Patience gazing on kings’ graves, and smiling	
Recount, I do beseech thee: come, sit by me.	
Patience, good sir,	
Or here I’ll cease.	
	
My father, and a king.	
But are you flesh and blood?	
And wherefore call’d Marina?

Did mock sad fools withal: this cannot be:	
You scorn: believe me, ’twere best I did give o’er.	
Of what you shall deliver. Yet, give me leave:	
A villain to attempt it, who having drawn to do’t,	
Whither will you have me?  Why do you weep? It may be,	
	
Calls my lord?	
I know not,	
And drown me with their sweetness.	
What was thy mother’s name? tell me but that,	
My drown’d queen’s name, as in the rest you said	
	
My temple stands in Ephesus: hie thee thither,	
And when you come ashore I have another suit.	
PERICLES.	
The regent made in Mytilene	
To greet the king. So he thrived,	
That he can hither come so soon,	
I here confess myself the King of Tyre;	
At Pentapolis the fair Thaisa.	
He sought to murder: but her better stars	
Noble sir,	
This is your wife.	
I threw her overboard with these very arms.	
’Tis most certain.	
A birth, and death?	
This, this: no more, you gods! your present kindness	
Hail, madam, and my queen!	
I have named him oft.	
’Twas Helicanus then.	
PERICLES.	
Lord Cerimon, my lord; this man,	
CERIMON.	
Where shall be shown you all was found with her;	
Pure Dian, bless thee for thy vision! I	
Makes me look dismal will I clip to form;	
	
	
In Antiochus and his daughter you have heard	
EARL BERKELEY	
QUEEN to King Richard	
Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?	
On some known ground of treachery in him?	
KING RICHARD. Then call them to our presence: face to face	
Enter BOLINGBROKE and MOWBRAY	
	
KING RICHARD. We thank you both; yet one but flatters us,	
Come I appellant to this princely presence.	
Or my divine soul answer it in heaven-	
I do defy him, and I spit at him,	
What I have spoke or thou canst worst devise.	
KING RICHARD. What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge?	
BOLINGBROKE. Look what I speak, my life shall prove it true-	
Like a false traitor and injurious villain.	
As he is but my father's brother's son,	
Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais	
For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,	
I did confess it, and exactly begg'd	
Let's purge this choler without letting blood-	
A jewel in a ten-times barr'd-up chest	
Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong	
At Coventry, upon Saint Lambert's day.	
	
Edward's seven sons, whereof thyself art one,	
Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! That bed, that womb,	
Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee.	
Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.	
Let heaven revenge; for I may never lift	
Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight.	
Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die;	
SCENE 3. The lists at Coventry	
a HERALD	
To swear him in the justice of his cause.	
And formally, according to our law,	
Then let us take a ceremonious leave	
And furbish new the name of John o' Gaunt,	
Fall like amazing thunder on the casque	
A loyal, just, and upright gentleman.	
This feast of battle with mine adversary.	
Go I to fight: truth hath a quiet breast.	
KING RICHARD. Farewell, my lord, securely I espy	
BOLINGBROKE. Strong as a tower in hope, I cry amen.	
Both to defend himself, and to approve	
To God, his sovereign, and to him disloyal,	
Courageously and with a free desire	
	
For that our kingdom's earth should not be soil'd	
With that dear blood which it hath fostered;	
With harsh-resounding trumpets' dreadful bray,	
The language I have learnt these forty years,	
Or like a cunning instrument cas'd up	
That knows no touch to tune the harmony.	
MOWBRAY. Then thus I turn me from my countrv's light,	
To dwell in solemn shades of endless night.	
Lay on our royal sword your banish'd hands;	
Nor never by advised purpose meet	
'Gainst us, our state, our subjects, or our land.	
MOWBRAY. And I, to keep all this.	
As now our flesh is banish'd from this land-	
MOWBRAY. No, Bolingbroke; if ever I were traitor,	
You would have bid me argue like a father.	
A partial slander sought I to avoid,	
As far as land will let me by your side.	
BOLINGBROKE. I have too few to take my leave of you,	
BOLINGBROKE. To men in joy; but grief makes one hour ten.	
Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set	
Suppose the singing birds musicians,	
By bare imagination of a feast?	
By thinking on fantastic summer's heat?	
SCENE 4. London. The court	
But to the next high way, and there I left him.	
Did grace our hollow parting with a tear.	
To counterfeit oppression of such grief	
He should have had a volume of farewells;	
As were our England in reversion his,	
GREEN. Well, he is gone; and with him go these thoughts!	
For their advantage and your Highness' loss.	
KING RICHARD. We will ourself in person to this war;	
Come, gentlemen, let's all go visit him.	
In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth?	
GAUNT. O, but they say the tongues of dying men	
He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes;	
Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,	
That England, that was wont to conquer others,	
Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.	
Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life,	
	
Ross, and WILLOUGHBY	
YORK. The King is come; deal mildly with his youth,	
KING RICHARD. What comfort, man? How is't with aged Gaunt?	
KING RICHARD. Should dying men flatter with those that live?	
GAUNT. O, no! thou diest, though I the sicker be.	
Of those physicians that first wounded thee:	
Whose compass is no bigger than thy head;	
From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame,	
Is it not more than shame to shame it so?	
Landlord of England art thou now, not King.	
Presuming on an ague's privilege,	
Live in thy shame, but die not shame with thee!	
As Harry Duke of Hereford, were he here.	
NORTHUMBERLAND. Nay, nothing; all is said.	
We must supplant those rough rug-headed kerns,	
And for these great affairs do ask some charge,	
The plate, coin, revenues, and moveables,	
About his marriage, nor my own disgrace,	
Accomplish'd with the number of thy hours;	
Which his triumphant father's hand had won.	
That their events can never fall out good.              Exit	
Come on, our queen; to-morrow must we part;	
ROSS. No good at all that I can do for him;	
The King is not himself, but basely led	
Merely in hate, 'gainst any of us an,	
ROSS. The commons hath he pill'd with grievous taxes;	
For ancient quarrels and quite lost their hearts.	
And unavoided is the danger now	
WILLOUGHBY. Nay, let us share thy thoughts as thou dost ours.	
Thy words are but as thoughts; therefore be bold.	
NORTHUMBERLAND. Then thus: I have from Le Port Blanc, a bay	
In Brittany, receiv'd intelligence	
Sir John Norbery, Sir Robert Waterton, and Francis Quoint-	
And shortly mean to touch our northern shore.	
Stay and be secret, and myself will go.	
Enter QUEEN, BUSHY, and BAGOT	
Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest	
Which, look'd on as it is, is nought but shadows	
I cannot name; 'tis nameless woe, I wot.	
Have woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow join'd.	
Who gently would dissolve the bands of life,	
	
Now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made;	
Bid her send me presently a thousand pound.	
The King had cut off my head with my brother's.	
How shall we do for money for these wars?	
Well, somewhat we must do.-Come, cousin,	
Exeunt YORK and QUEEN	
	
And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar,	
BOLINGBROKE. Of much less value is my company	
Than your good words. But who comes here?	
And as my fortune ripens with thy love,	
NORTHUMBERLAND. How far is it to Berkeley? And what stir	
PERCY. There stands the castle, by yon tuft of trees,	
A banish'd traitor. All my treasury	
And I must find that title in your tongue	
Before I make reply to aught you say.	
BERKELEY. Mistake me not, my lord; 'tis not my meaning	
The Duke of York, to know what pricks you on	
And fright our native peace with self-borne arms.	
To upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I born?	
To my inheritance of free descent.	
WILLOUGHBY. Base men by his endowments are made great.	
I have had feeling of my cousin's wrongs,	
But since I cannot, be it known unto you	
By Bushy, Bagot, and their complices,	
	
Enter EARL OF SALISBURY and a WELSH CAPTAIN	
And meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven;	
And lean-look'd prophets whisper fearful change;	
	
With too much urging your pernicious lives,	
To execution and the hand of death.	
Tell her I send to her my kind commends;	
Throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies.	
And not neglected; else, if heaven would,	
Who all this while hath revell'd in the night,	
	
O'erthrows thy joys, friends, fortune, and thy state;	
Have I not reason to look pale and dead?	
Enter SCROOP	
Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores,	
Against thy seat: both young and old rebel,	
With heads, and not with hands; those whom you curse	
Make dust our paper, and with rainy eyes	
This ague fit of fear is over-blown;	
And all your northern castles yielded up,	
And all your southern gentlemen in arms	
With some few private friends upon this coast.	
When such a sacred king should hide his head!	
YORK. The time hath been,	
It doth contain a king; King Richard lies	
Of holy reverence; who, I cannot learn.	
Into his ruin'd ears, and thus deliver:	
Henry Bolingbroke	
And lands restor'd again be freely granted;	
That from this castle's tottered battlements	
March on, and mark King Richard how he looks.	
Parle without, and answer within; then a flourish.	
To watch the fearful bending of thy knee,	
Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre,	
Unless he do profane, steal, or usurp.	
And by the honourable tomb he swears	
And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt,	
This swears he, as he is a prince, is just;	
Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends.	
To look so poorly and to speak so fair?	
KING RICHARD. O God, O God! that e'er this tongue of mine	
On yon proud man should take it off again	
Or that I could forget what I have been!	
Swell'st thou, proud heart? I'll give thee scope to beat,	
My gorgeous palace for a hermitage,	
May hourly trample on their sovereign's head;	
To come at traitors' calls, and do them grace.	
Yet he is come.	
To make the base earth proud with kissing it.	
	
To drive away the heavy thought of care?	
But thou shouldst please me better wouldst thou weep.	
The noisome weeds which without profit suck	
SERVANT. Why should we, in the compass of a pale,	
GARDENER. Hold thy peace.	
SERVANT. What, are they dead?	
Do wound the bark, the skin of our fruit trees,	
King Richard, he is in the mighty hold	
And with that odds he weighs King Richard down.	
Gard'ner, for telling me these news of woe,	
PERCY, FITZWATER, SURREY, the BISHOP OF CARLISLE, the ABBOT OF	
What thou dost know of noble Gloucester's death;	
BOLINGBROKE. Cousin, stand forth, and look upon that man.	
Than Bolingbroke's return to England;	
AUMERLE. Thou dar'st not, coward, live to see that day.	
Engage it to the trial, if thou dar'st.	
And lies, and lies. There is my bond of faith,	
BOLINGBROKE. These differences shall all rest under gage	
Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross	
Your differences shall all rest under gage	
Anointed, crowned, planted many years,	
Lest child, child's children, cry against you woe.	
The favours of these men. Were they not mine?	
God save the King! Will no man say amen?	
And yet, amen, if heaven do think him me.	
YORK. To do that office of thine own good will	
The resignation of thy state and crown	
The emptier ever dancing in the air,	
Your care is gain of care, by new care won.	
All pomp and majesty I do forswear;	
Made glory base, and sovereignty a slave,	
NORTHUMBERLAND. My lord-	
O that I were a mockery king of snow,	
An if my word be sterling yet in England,	
KING RICHARD. Fiend, thou torments me ere I come to hell.	
KING RICHARD. They shall be satisfied. I'll read enough,	
Where all my sins are writ, and that's myself.	
Like to my followers in prosperity,	
'Tis very true: my grief lies all within;	
Were then but subjects; being now a subject,	
BOLINGBROKE. You shall.	
KING RICHARD. O, good! Convey! Conveyers are you all,	
To rid the realm of this pernicious blot?	
Shows us but this: I am sworn brother, sweet,	
Thine intellect? Hath he been in thy heart?	
And fawn on rage with base humility,	
Good sometimes queen, prepare thee hence for France.	
And send the hearers weeping to their beds;	
Enter NORTHUMBERLAND attended	
NORTHUMBERLAND. My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is chang'd;	
Better far off than near, be ne'er the near.	
Come, come, in wooing sorrow let's be brief,	
Thus give I mine, and thus take I thy heart.	
QUEEN. Give me mine own again; 'twere no good part	
KING RICHARD. We make woe wanton with this fond delay.	
Of our two cousins' coming into London.	
Where rude misgoverned hands from windows' tops	
And thus still doing, thus he pass'd along.	
Thinking his prattle to be tedious;	
I am in Parliament pledge for his truth	
YORK. What seal is that that without thy bosom?	
AUMERLE. My lord, 'tis nothing.	
YORK. No matter, then, who see it.	
It is a matter of small consequence	
'Tis nothing but some bond that he is ent'red into	
[He plucks it out of his bosom, and reads it]	
Treason, foul treason! Villain! traitor! slave!	
I will appeach the villain.	
His man enters with his boots	
	
YORK. Thou fond mad woman,	
DUCHESS. He shall be none;	
	
And from the common'st creature pluck a glove	
	
The treason that my haste forbids me show.	
Thou sheer, immaculate, and silver fountain,	
As thriftless sons their scraping fathers' gold.	
Thou kill'st me in his life; giving him breath,	
DUCHESS. Not yet, I thee beseech.	
AUMERLE. Unto my mother's prayers I bend my knee.	
Our knees still kneel till to the ground they grow.	
An if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach,	
Ah, my sour husband, my hard-hearted lord,	
BOLINGBROKE. I pardon him, as God shall pardon me.	
DUCHESS. A god on earth thou art.	
Good uncle, help to order several powers	
	
This prison where I live unto the world	
With scruples, and do set the word itself	
Persuades me I was better when a king;	
Nor I, nor any man that but man is,	
Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,	
Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,	
Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.	
Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!	
That horse that thou so often hast bestrid,	
KING RICHARD. Rode he on Barbary? Tell me, gentle friend,	
GROOM. So proudly as if he disdain'd the ground.	
This hand hath made him proud with clapping him.	
Since pride must have a fall, and break the neck	
KEEPER. My lord, will't please you to fall to?	
KING RICHARD. Taste of it first as thou art wont to do.	
[Beats the KEEPER]	
For now the devil, that told me I did well,	
Says that this deed is chronicled in hell.	
The heads of Salisbury, Spencer, Blunt, and Kent.	
	
BOLINGBROKE. Thy pains, Fitzwater, shall not be forgot;

Well are you welcome to the open air.	
How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?	
That were the cause of my imprisonment.	
Where is he? In his bed?	
	
Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!	
I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.	
Cursed the heart that had the heart to do it!	
More direful hap betide that hated wretch	
And that be heir to his unhappiness!	
If ever he have wife, let her be made

If not that, I am Queen, you bow like subjects,

O God that seest it, do not suffer it;	
As it is won with blood, lost be it so!	
Now fair befall thee and thy noble house!

But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,	
FIRST MURDERER. We will, my noble lord.                 Exeunt

FIRST MURDERER. I thought thou hadst been resolute.	
It is turn'd out of towns and cities for a dangerous thing;	
SECOND MURDERER. You shall have wine enough, my lord,	
CLARENCE. How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!	
Unto the frowning judge, or who pronounc'd

Those uncles which you want were dangerous;	
PRINCE. Welcome, my lord. What, will our mother come?	
HASTINGS. On what occasion, God He knows, not I,	
But by his mother was perforce withheld.	
And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.	
Too ceremonious and traditional.	
This Prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserv'd it,	
You break no privilege nor charter there.	
Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,	
Methinks the truth should Eve from age to age,	
Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;	
PRINCE. An if I live until I be a man,	
Or die a soldier as I liv'd a king.	
YORK. Well, my dread lord; so must I can you now.	
YORK. I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.	
YORK. Of my kind uncle, that I know will give,	
GLOUCESTER. Ay, gentle cousin, were it light enough.	
In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.	
BUCKINGHAM. With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!	
He prettily and aptly taunts himself.	
YORK. I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.	
But come, my lord; and with a heavy heart,	
Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, and CATESBY	
GLOUCESTER. No doubt, no doubt. O, 'tis a perilous boy;	
He is all the mother's, from the top to toe.	
CATESBY. He for his father's sake so loves the Prince	
BUCKINGHAM. Well then, no more but this: go, gentle	
How he doth stand affected to our purpose;	
And summon him to-morrow to the Tower,	
	
	
HASTINGS. What then?	
And that may be determin'd at the one	
Bid him not fear the separated council:	
Were to incense the boar to follow us

What news, what news, in this our tott'ring state?	
Till Richard wear the garland of the realm.

HASTINGS. I'll have this crown of mine cut from my

HASTINGS. But I shall laugh at this a twelve month hence,	
To princely Richard and to Buckingham.	
HASTINGS. Go on before; I'll talk with this good fellow.	
But now, I tell thee-keep it to thyself-	
PRIEST. I'll wait upon your lordship.	
Enter BUCKINGHAM	
	
	
RIVERS. Come, Grey; come, Vaughan; let us here embrace.	
DERBY. It is, and wants but nomination.	
BUCKINGHAM. Who knows the Lord Protector's mind	
BUCKINGHAM. We know each other's faces; for our hearts,	
His gracious pleasure any way therein.	
	
BISHOP OF ELY. In happy time, here comes the Duke himself.	
Exeunt GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM	
For I myself am not so well provided	
	
Re-enter the BISHOP OF ELY	
	
Off with his head! Now by Saint Paul I swear	
As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house.	
I now repent I told the pursuivant,	
RATCLIFF. Come, come, dispatch; the Duke would be at	
Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,	
Ready with every nod to tumble down	
I prophesy the fearfull'st time to thee	
That ever wretched age hath look'd upon.	
They smile at me who shortly shall be dead.           Exeunt	
	
As if thou were distraught and mad with terror?	
But what, is Catesby gone?	
BUCKINGHAM. God and our innocence defend and guard us!	
	
The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.	
So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue	
He liv'd from all attainder of suspects.	
MAYOR. Had he done so?	
But that the extreme peril of the case,	
The peace of England and our persons' safety,	
I never look'd for better at his hands	
BUCKINGHAM. Yet had we not determin'd he should die	
Misconster us in him and wail his death.	
Only for saying he would make his son	
Heir to the crown-meaning indeed his house,	
Found that the issue was not his begot;	
BUCKINGHAM. Doubt not, my lord, I'll play the orator	
GLOUCESTER. Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's	
Which when I saw, I reprehended them,	
And stand between two churchmen, good my lord;	
For on that ground I'll make a holy descant;	
GLOUCESTER. I go; and if you plead as well for them	
knocks.                                      Exit GLOUCESTER	
Welcome, my lord. I dance attendance here;

In this just cause come I to move your Grace.	
GLOUCESTER. I cannot tell if to depart in silence	
First, if all obstacles were cut away,	
As the ripe revenue and due of birth,	
Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,	
Unto a lineal true-derived course.	
BUCKINGHAM. Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.	
Yet know, whe'er you accept our suit or no,	
Come, citizens. Zounds, I'll entreat no more.	
But penetrable to your kind entreaties,	
But if black scandal or foul-fac'd reproach	
How far I am from the desire of this.

You’ll not endure him! God shall mend my soul,

ROMEO.	
[_To Juliet._] If I profane with my unworthiest hand	
To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.	
Which mannerly devotion shows in this;	
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do:	
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers’ sake.	
JULIET.	
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.	
Shall have the chinks.	
My only love sprung from my only hate!	
Come let’s away, the strangers all are gone.

Having some business, do entreat her eyes	
JULIET.	
She speaks.	
As glorious to this night, being o’er my head,	
O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?	
’Tis but thy name that is my enemy;	
And for thy name, which is no part of thee,	
	
Had I it written, I would tear the word.	
How cam’st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?	
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.	
JULIET.	
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye	
	
I have night’s cloak to hide me from their eyes,	
JULIET.	
By love, that first did prompt me to enquire;	
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say Ay,	
And therefore thou mayst think my ’haviour light:	
Which is the god of my idolatry,	
If my heart’s dear love,—

Th’exchange of thy love’s faithful vow for mine.	
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;	
JULIET.	
Stay but a little, I will come again.	
ROMEO.

Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite,	
I come, anon.— But if thou meanest not well,	
To cease thy strife and leave me to my grief.	
Tomorrow will I send.

I will not fail. ’Tis twenty years till then.

Where is she? And how doth she? And what says	
ROMEO.	
As if that name,	
Art thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art.	
Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?	
There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,	
And turns it to exile; there art thou happy.	
A pack of blessings light upon thy back;	
Happiness courts thee in her best array;	
For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;	
To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,	
Beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back	
Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.	
But that a joy past joy calls out on me,	
	
And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?

Since you did leave it for my office, sir.	
ROMEO.	
And hereabouts he dwells,—which late I noted	
Sharp misery had worn him to the bones;	
And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,	
As violently as hasty powder fir’d	
Farewell, buy food, and get thyself in flesh.	
	
Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.	
And finding him, the searchers of the town,	
Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake.	
	
	
O woe, thy canopy is dust and stones,	
ROMEO.	
Why I descend into this bed of death	
Is partly to behold my lady’s face,	
But if thou jealous dost return to pry	
In what I further shall intend to do,	
BALTHASAR.	
	
BALTHASAR.

Go with me to the vault.	
	
My master knows not but I am gone hence,	
O comfortable Friar, where is my lord?

Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.

This is the place. There, where the torch doth burn.	
	
Go, some of you, whoe’er you find attach.	
We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,	
Here’s Romeo’s man. We found him in the churchyard.	
THIRD WATCH. Here is a Friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.	
FIRST WATCH.	
What should it be that they so shriek abroad?	
LADY CAPULET.	
What fear is this which startles in our ears?	
Is empty on the back of Montague,	
LADY CAPULET.	
	
You, to remove that siege of grief from her,	
The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo	
And bear this work of heaven with patience.	
We still have known thee for a holy man.	
This letter he early bid me give his father,	
	
There shall no figure at such rate be set	
As that of true and faithful Juliet.	
As rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie,	
Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things.

And each one to his office when he wakes.

No better than a poor and loathsome beggar.	
And if the boy have not a woman’s gift

An onion will do well for such a shift,

[_Exeunt._]	
What raiment will your honour wear today?	
nay, sometime more feet than shoes, or such shoes as my toes look	
Should be infused with so foul a spirit!	
O! this it is that makes your lady mourn.	
LORD.	
As beaten hence by your strange lunacy.	
Or wilt thou ride? Thy horses shall be trapp’d,	
	
We’ll show thee Io as she was a maid	
And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep,	
Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door,	
	
	
Marry, I fare well; for here is cheer enough.

Flourish. Enter Lucentio and Tranio.	
And by my father’s love and leave am arm’d	
And am to Padua come as he that leaves

But stay awhile; what company is this?	
There, there, Hortensio, will you any wife?

Such as the daughter of Agenor had,	
TRANIO.	
I pray, awake, sir: if you love the maid,	
Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father’s he!	
LUCENTIO.	
You will be schoolmaster,	
Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends;	
_Basta_, content thee, for I have it full.	
LUCENTIO.	
Enter Biondello.	
	
Or you stol’n his? or both? Pray, what’s the news?	
	
SCENE II. Padua. Before HORTENSIO’S house.	
Enter Petruchio and his man Grumio.	
	
PETRUCHIO.	
Knock you here, sir? Why, sir, what am I, sir, that I should knock you	
And rap me well, or I’ll knock your knave’s pate.	
	
PETRUCHIO.	
How now! what’s the matter? My old friend Grumio! and my good friend	
Petruchio! How do you all at Verona?	
	
Nay, ’tis no matter, sir, what he ’leges in Latin. If this be not a

A proper stripling, and an amorous!	
GREMIO.	
All books of love, see that at any hand,	
And let me have them very well perfum’d;	
LUCENTIO.	
Whate’er I read to her, I’ll plead for you,	
	
HORTENSIO.	
	
And by good fortune I have lighted well	
On this young man; for learning and behaviour	
And other books, good ones, I warrant ye.	
Hath promis’d me to help me to another,	
HORTENSIO.	
Will undertake to woo curst Katherine;	
Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please.	
But if you have a stomach, to’t a God’s name;	
You shall have me assisting you in all.	
	
PETRUCHIO.	
Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?	
GREMIO.	
To the house of Signior Baptista Minola?	
BIONDELLO.	
	
PETRUCHIO.	
	
Softly, my masters! If you be gentlemen,	
LUCENTIO.	
	
And if you break the ice, and do this feat,	
HORTENSIO.	
Sir, you say well, and well you do conceive;	
	
	
BIANCA.	
Believe me, sister, of all the men alive	
KATHERINA.	
You will have Gremio to keep you fair.	
	
Why dost thou wrong her that did ne’er wrong thee?	
	
	
BAPTISTA.

And you, good sir! Pray, have you not a daughter	
I have a daughter, sir, call’d Katherina.	
Within your house, to make mine eye the witness

Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,	
[_To Hortensio_.] Take you the lute,	
[_To Lucentio_.] and you the set of books;	
	
PETRUCHIO.	
	
Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?	
Proceed in practice with my younger daughter;	
Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?	
Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate,	
Myself am mov’d to woo thee for my wife.	
KATHERINA.	
	
	
Asses are made to bear, and so are you.	
Women are made to bear, and so are you.	
Should be! should buz!	
PETRUCHIO.	
Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies.	
Whose tongue?	
	
	
’Twas told me you were rough, and coy, and sullen,	
	
That you shall be my wife your dowry ’greed on;	
Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;	
	
	
To buy apparel ’gainst the wedding-day.	
I will to Venice; Sunday comes apace;	
BAPTISTA.	
The gain I seek is, quiet in the match.	
	
I am your neighbour, and was suitor first.	
TRANIO.	
TRANIO.	
	
Pewter and brass, and all things that belong	
Besides two thousand ducats by the year	
Two thousand ducats by the year of land!	
	
She is your own; else, you must pardon me;	
Adieu, good neighbour.

And, to cut off all strife, here sit we down;

But let it rest. Now, Licio, to you.	
Good master, take it not unkindly, pray,	
HORTENSIO.	
	
BIANCA.	
Yet read the gamut of Hortensio.	
_C fa ut_, that loves with all affection:	
But I have cause to pry into this pedant:	
Enter Baptista, Gremio, Tranio, Katherina, Bianca, Lucentio and	
BAPTISTA.  [_To Tranio_.]	
That Katherine and Petruchio should be married,	
To give my hand, oppos’d against my heart,	
And to be noted for a merry man,	
Make friends, invite, and proclaim the banns;	
[_Exit weeping, followed by Bianca and others._]	
Enter Biondello.

a linen stock on one leg and a kersey boot-hose on the other, gartered	
’Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion;	
And yet not many.	
First were we sad, fearing you would not come;	
PETRUCHIO.	
Which at more leisure I will so excuse	
The morning wears, ’tis time we were at church.	
See not your bride in these unreverent robes;	
PETRUCHIO.	
’Twere well for Kate and better for myself.

Her father’s liking; which to bring to pass,	
As I before imparted to your worship,

Enter Petrucio, Katherina, Bianca, Baptista, Hortensio, Grumio and

To this most patient, sweet, and virtuous wife.	
O Kate! content thee: prithee be not angry.

And ’tis my hope to end successfully.

I read that I profess, _The Art to Love_.	
[_They retire._]	
Know, sir, that I am call’d Hortensio.

In resolution as I swore before.

I’ faith, he’ll have a lusty widow now,

TRANIO.	
O master, master! I have watch’d so long	
BIONDELLO.	
Travel you far on, or are you at the farthest?	
But then up farther, and as far as Rome;	
My life, sir! How, I pray? for that goes hard.	
’Tis marvel, but that you are but newly come	
PEDANT.	
Among them know you one Vincentio?	
	
	
TRANIO.	
Then go with me to make the matter good.	
GRUMIO.	
GRUMIO.	
	
	
Go, get thee gone, I say.	
PETRUCHIO.	
Pluck up thy spirits; look cheerfully upon me.	
HORTENSIO.	
Enter Tailor.	
Enter Haberdasher.	
Here is the cap your worship did bespeak.	
And it I will have, or I will have none.	
O mercy, God! what masquing stuff is here?	
What’s this? A sleeve? ’Tis like a demi-cannon.	
Like to a censer in a barber’s shop.	
Belike you mean to make a puppet of me.	
	
	
Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter-cricket thou!	
	
TAILOR.	
TAILOR.	
GRUMIO.	
Thou hast faced many things.	
	
GRUMIO.	
I confess the cape.	
	
	
I am for thee straight; take thou the bill, give me thy mete-yard, and	
Why, sir, what’s your conceit in that?	
PETRUCHIO.	
[_To Tailor._] Go take it hence; be gone, and say no more.	
Away, I say! commend me to thy master.	
Look what I speak, or do, or think to do,	
SCENE IV. Padua. Before BAPTISTA’S house.	
	
I told him that your father was at Venice,	
And that you look’d for him this day in Padua.	
Th’art a tall fellow; hold thee that to drink.	
	
[_To the Pedant_] Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of;	
And for the love he beareth to your daughter,	
Right true it is your son Lucentio here	
Doth love my daughter, and she loveth him,	
That like a father you will deal with him,	
The worst is this, that at so slender warning	
I follow you.	
	
	
Biondello, what of that?	
BIONDELLO.	
	
I may, and will, if she be so contented.	
It shall go hard if Cambio go without her:	
The moon! The sun; it is not moonlight now.	
I say it is the moon that shines so bright.	
HORTENSIO.	
Petruchio, go thy ways; the field is won.	
But, soft! Company is coming here.	
Enter Vincentio, in a travelling dress.	
Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman?	
PETRUCHIO.	
And not a maiden, as thou sayst he is.	
	
	
master’s as soon as I can.	
I marvel Cambio comes not all this while.	
Enter Pedant above, at a window.	
Is Signior Lucentio within, sir?	
What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two to make merry withal?	
	
To leave frivolous circumstances, I pray you tell Signior Lucentio that	
Ay, sir; so his mother says, if I may believe her.	
	
	
But who is here? Mine old master, Vincentio! Now we are undone and	
	
What, my old worshipful old master? Yes, marry, sir; see where he looks

VINCENTIO.	
O! we are spoiled; and yonder he is: deny him, forswear him, or else we	
	
[_Kneeling._] Pardon, dear father.	
Where is Lucentio?	
Cambio is chang’d into Lucentio.	
Unto the wished haven of my bliss.	
	
	
	
GREMIO.	
PETRUCHIO.	
Why, then, let’s home again. Come, sirrah, let’s away.	
	
	
PETRUCHIO.	
PETRUCHIO.	
	
I mean Hortensio is afeard of you.	
KATHERINA.	
	
My widow says thus she conceives her tale.	
Right, I mean you.	
	
	
BAPTISTA.	
	
To come at first when he doth send for her,	
	
HORTENSIO.	
	
I’ll have no halves; I’ll bear it all myself.	
PETRUCHIO.	
Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife	
	
I am afraid, sir,	
What?	
	
	
KATHERINA.	
Where is your sister, and Hortensio’s wife?	
PETRUCHIO.	
PETRUCHIO.	
And, to be short, what not that’s sweet and happy.	
	
PETRUCHIO.	
And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty	
To painful labour both by sea and land,	
To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,	
Too little payment for so great a debt.	
To offer war where they should kneel for peace,	
Why, there’s a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.	
LUCENTIO.	
PETRUCHIO.	
Come, Kate, we’ll to bed.	
And being a winner, God give you good night!

Trumpets sound. Enter ALCIBIADES with his powers before Athens

And so I love and honour thee and thine,	
And her to whom my thoughts are humbled all,	
I thank you all and here dismiss you all,	
Open the gates and let me in.	
[Flourish. They go up into the Senate House]	
Lo, as the bark that hath discharg'd her fraught	
These that survive let Rome reward with love;	
With burial amongst their ancestors.	
How many sons hast thou of mine in store	
Victorious Titus, rue the tears I shed,	
A mother's tears in passion for her son;	
Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome	
Were piety in thine, it is in these.	
TAMORA. O cruel, irreligious piety!	
DEMETRIUS. Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome.	
May favour Tamora, the Queen of Goths-	
To quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes.	
Lavinia, live; outlive thy father's days,	
	
Rome, I have been thy soldier forty years,	
In right and service of their noble country.	
SATURNINUS. Proud and ambitious Tribune, canst thou tell?	
SATURNINUS. Titus Andronicus, for thy favours done	
I give thee thanks in part of thy deserts,	
I hold me highly honoured of your Grace,	
King and commander of our commonweal,	
My sword, my chariot, and my prisoners,	
That I would choose, were I to choose anew.-	
Thou com'st not to be made a scorn in Rome-	
Warrants these words in princely courtesy.	
SATURNINUS. Thanks, sweet Lavinia. Romans, let us go.	
MARCUS. Suum cuique is our Roman justice:	
TITUS. Traitors, avaunt! Where is the Emperor's guard?	
SATURNINUS. Surpris'd! By whom?	
Bear his betroth'd from all the world away.	
Exeunt BASSIANUS and MARCUS with LAVINIA	
	
Re-enter aloft the EMPEROR	
That saidst I begg'd the empire at thy hands.	
And will create thee Emperess of Rome.	
And tapers burn so bright, and everything	
I will not re-salute the streets of Rome,	
TAMORA. And here in sight of heaven to Rome I swear,	
She will a handmaid be to his desires,	
In a bad quarrel slain a virtuous son.	
LUCIUS. But let us give him burial, as becomes;	
MARCUS. No, noble Titus, but entreat of thee	
MARTIUS. He is not with himself; let us withdraw.	
ALL.  [Kneeling]  No man shed tears for noble Mutius;	
That, in the rescue of Lavinia,	
With his own hand did slay his youngest son,	
How I have lov'd and honoured Saturnine!	
You are but newly planted in your throne;	
Kneel in the streets and beg for grace in vain.-	
TITUS. I thank your Majesty and her, my lord;	
That what we did was mildly as we might,	
TAMORA. Nay, nay, sweet Emperor, we must all be friends.	
Advanc'd above pale envy's threat'ning reach.	
As when the golden sun salutes the morn,	
I will be bright and shine in pearl and gold,	
To wait upon this new-made emperess.	
This goddess, this Semiramis, this nymph,	
	
And may, for aught thou knowest, affected be.	
Full well shalt thou perceive how much I dare.	
The cause were known to them it most concerns;	
Or Bassianus so degenerate,	
She is Lavinia, therefore must be lov'd.	
AARON. Would you had hit it too!	
That you affect; and so must you resolve	
My lords, a solemn hunting is in hand;	
And many unfrequented plots there are	
And strike her home by force if not by words.	
TITUS. The hunt is up, the morn is bright and grey,	
Here a cry of hounds, and wind horns in a peal.	
LAVINIA. I say no;	
SATURNINUS. Come on then, horse and chariots let us have,	
TAMORA. My lovely Aaron, wherefore look'st thou sad	
And while the babbling echo mocks the hounds,	
AARON. Madam, though Venus govern your desires,	
To do some fatal execution?	
Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,	
Hark, Tamora, the empress of my soul,	
Now question me no more; we are espied.	
Enter BASSIANUS and LAVINIA	
BASSIANUS. Who have we here? Rome's royal Emperess,	
TAMORA. Saucy controller of my private steps!	
Why are you sequest'red from all your train,	
Accompanied but with a barbarous Moor,	
This valley fits the purpose passing well.	
A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,	
Should straight fall mad or else die suddenly.	
This vengeance on me had they executed.	
DEMETRIUS. This is a witness that I am thy son.	
First thrash the corn, then after burn the straw.	
That nice-preserved honesty of yours.	
The milk thou suck'dst from her did turn to marble,	
Some say that ravens foster forlorn children,	
TAMORA. I know not what it means; away with her!	
Be not obdurate, open thy deaf ears.	
And with thine own hands kill me in this place!	
No, let them satisfy their lust on thee.	
Re-enter AARON, with two	
[Falls into the pit]	
AARON.  [Aside]  Now will I fetch the King to find them here,	
In this detested, dark, blood-drinking pit.	
QUINTUS. Thy hand once more; I will not loose again,	
Enter the EMPEROR and AARON the Moor	
MARTIUS. The unhappy sons of old Andronicus,	
An if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe.	
CHIRON. Go home, call for sweet water, wash thy hands.	
DEMETRIUS. If thou hadst hands to help thee knit the cord.	
Coming and going with thy honey breath.	
And, lest thou shouldst detect him, cut thy tongue.	
Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan's face	
Blushing to be encount'red with a cloud.	
That could have better sew'd than Philomel.	
And make the silken strings delight to kiss them,	
And for these bitter tears, which now you see	
My heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears.	
	
And let me say, that never wept before,	
And tribunes with their tongues doom men to death.	
For now I stand as one upon a rock,	
Expecting ever when some envious surge	
But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn	
When I did name her brothers, then fresh tears	
With miry slime left on them by a flood?	
And made a brine-pit with our bitter tears?	
LUCIUS. Sweet father, cease your tears; for at your grief	
MARCUS. Patience, dear niece. Good Titus, dry thine eyes.	
	
	
Sends thee this word, that, if thou love thy sons,	
Or any one of you, chop off your hand	
Will send thee hither both thy sons alive,	
Shall not be sent. My hand will serve the turn,	
Writing destruction on the enemy's castle?	
O, none of both but are of high desert!	
TITUS. Sirs, strive no more; such with'red herbs as these	
LUCIUS. Sweet father, if I shall be thought thy son,	
Let me redeem my brothers both from death.	
But I'll deceive you in another sort,	
Look by and by to have thy sons with thee.	
[Aside]  Their heads I mean. O, how this villainy	
And do not break into these deep extremes.	
For that good hand thou sent'st the Emperor.	
And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs.	
And if ye love me, as I think you do,	
	
When thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating,	
Thou canst not strike it thus to make it still.	
Drown the lamenting fool in sea-salt tears.	
Fie, fie, how franticly I square my talk,	
As begging hermits in their holy prayers.	
BOY. Good grandsire, leave these bitter deep laments;	
Make my aunt merry with some pleasing tale.	
MARCUS. Alas, the tender boy, in passion mov'd,	
And buzz lamenting doings in the air!	
Yet, I think, we are not brought so low	
MARCUS. Alas, poor man! grief has so wrought on him,	
TITUS. Come, take away. Lavinia, go with me;	
See, Lucius, see how much she makes of thee.	
For I have heard my grandsire say full oft	
TITUS. Soft! So busily she turns the leaves! Help her.	
[He writes his name with his	
Write thou, good niece, and here display at last	
and guides it with stumps, and writes]	
MARCUS. What, what! the lustful sons of Tamora	
TITUS. Magni Dominator poli,	
And where's our lesson, then? Boy, what say you?	
MARCUS. O heavens, can you hear a good man groan	
Revenge the heavens for old Andronicus!                 Exit	
	
BOY.  [Aside]  That you are both decipher'd, that's the news,	
My grandsire, well advis'd, hath sent by me	
The goodliest weapons of his armoury	
You may be armed and appointed well.	
And now, young lords, was't not a happy star	
Led us to Rome, strangers, and more than so,	
For our beloved mother in her pains.	
O, tell me, did you see Aaron the Moor?	
NURSE. A joyless, dismal, black, and sorrowful issue!	
CHIRON. It shall not live.	
Stay, murderous villains, will you kill your brother!	
What, what, ye sanguine, shallow-hearted boys!	
NURSE. The Emperor in his rage will doom her death.	
As who should say 'Old lad, I am thine own.'	
And we will all subscribe to thy advice.	
AARON. Why, so, brave lords! When we join in league	
And let the Emperor dandle him for his own.	
And you must needs bestow her funeral;	
Then let the ladies tattle what they please.	
DEMETRIUS. For this care of Tamora,	
	
Enter TITUS, bearing arrows with letters on the ends of them; with him	
Happily you may catch her in the sea;	
I pray you deliver him this petition.	
And that it comes from old Andronicus,	
PUBLIUS. Therefore, my lords, it highly us concerns	
Take wreak on Rome for this ingratitude,	
And vengeance on the traitor Saturnine.	
'Ad Martem' that's for myself.	
The Bull, being gall'd, gave Aries such a knock	
TITUS. Why, there it goes! God give his lordship joy!	
TITUS. Why, didst thou not come from heaven?	
going with my pigeons to the Tribunal Plebs, to take up a matter	
of brawl betwixt my uncle and one of the Emperal's men.	
CLOWN. Nay, truly, sir, I could never say grace in all my life.	
But give your pigeons to the Emperor;	
Knock at my door, and tell me what he says.	
	
But even with law against the wilful sons	
See, here's 'To Jove' and this 'To Mercury';	
What's this but libelling against the Senate,	
And blazoning our unjustice every where?	
High-witted Tamora to gloze with all.	
SATURNINUS. Go take him away, and hang him presently.	
Shall I endure this monstrous villainy?	
As flowers with frost, or grass beat down with storms.	
TAMORA. Why should you fear? Is not your city strong?	
SATURNINUS. Ay, but the citizens favour Lucius,	
And will revolt from me to succour him.	
SATURNINUS. But he will not entreat his son for us.	
[To AEMILIUS]  Go thou before to be our ambassador;	
	
FIRST GOTH. Brave slip, sprung from the great Andronicus,	
Like stinging bees in hottest summer's day,	
To use as you think needful of the man.	
A halter, soldiers! Hang him on this tree,	
If thou wilt not, befall what may befall,	
That granted, how canst thou believe an oath?	
Yet, for I know thou art religious	
As true a dog as ever fought at head.	
And hid the gold within that letter mention'd,	
And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.	
As willingly as one would kill a fly;	
But that I cannot do ten thousand more.	
GOTH. My lord, there is a messenger from Rome	
He craves a parley at your father's house,	
Knock at his study, where they say he keeps	
TITUS. Who doth molest my contemplation?	
TITUS. I am not mad, I know thee well enough:	
Witness these trenches made by grief and care;	
Witness the tiring day and heavy night;	
To ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind	
And whirl along with thee about the globes.	
Until his very downfall in the sea.	
TAMORA. This closing with him fits his lunacy.	
I'll find some cunning practice out of hand	
How like the Empress and her sons you are!	
But welcome as you are. What shall we do?	
Bid him encamp his soldiers where they are.	
MARCUS. This will I do, and soon return again.            Exit	
The one is Murder, and Rape is the other's name;	
Oft have you heard me wish for such an hour,	
Two of her brothers were condemn'd to death,	
SCENE III. The court of TITUS' house	
This ravenous tiger, this accursed devil;	
And see the ambush of our friends be strong;	
I fear the Emperor means no good to us.	
The venomous malice of my swelling heart!	
Exeunt GOTHS with AARON. Flourish within	
The trumpets show the Emperor is at hand.	
	
like a cook, placing the dishes, and LAVINIA	
TITUS. Welcome, my lord; welcome, dread Queen;	
SATURNINUS. What, was she ravish'd? Tell who did the deed.	
[He stabs TITUS]	
There's meed for meed, death for a deadly deed.	
[He stabs SATURNINUS. A great tumult. LUCIUS,	
MARCUS, and their friends go up into the balcony]	
By uproars sever'd, as a flight of fowl	
Grave witnesses of true experience,	
Speak, Romans, speak; and if you say we shall,	
MARCUS. Go, go into old Titus' sorrowful house,	
As punishment for his most wicked life.          Exeunt some	
LUCIUS. Thanks, gentle Romans! May I govern so	
To heal Rome's harms and wipe away her woe!	
O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips.  [Kisses TITUS]	
MARCUS. Tear for tear and loving kiss for kiss	
LUCIUS. Come hither, boy; come, come, come, and learn of us	
And bid thee bear his pretty tales in mind	
Re-enter attendants with AARON

DRAMATIS PERSONAE	
SPEED, a clownish servant to Valentine	
	
Were't not affection chains thy tender days	
Than, living dully sluggardiz'd at home,	
Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.	
VALENTINE. That's on some shallow story of deep love:	
Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphis'd me,	
Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,	
Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.	
	
And I have play'd the sheep in losing him.	
SPEED. Why then, my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep.	
PROTEUS. No, no; you shall have it for bearing the letter.	
SPEED. Truly, sir, I think you'll hardly win her.

To whisper and conspire against my youth?	
There, take the paper; see it be return'd;	
And pray her to a fault for which I chid her.	
JULIA. Why didst thou stoop then?	
LUCETTA. Madam, it will not lie where it concerns,	
LUCETTA. It is too heavy for so light a tune.	
JULIA. And why not you?	
JULIA. Let's see your song.     [LUCETTA withholds the letter]	
And yet methinks I do not like this tune.	
LUCETTA. Nay, now you are too flat	
JULIA. The mean is drown'd with your unruly bass.	
You would be fing'ring them, to anger me.

Then let her beauty be her wedding-dow'r;

Take no repulse, whatever she doth say;

To cast up with a pair of anchoring hooks,

DUKE. Then let me see thy cloak.	
My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them,	
Because myself do want my servants' fortune.	
What's here?	
To die is to be banish'd from myself,	
Is self from self, a deadly banishment.	
What light is light, if Silvia be not seen?	
PROTEUS. What seest thou?	
PROTEUS. Who wouldst thou strike?	
VALENTINE. No Valentine, indeed, for sacred Silvia.

Of all that may concern thy love affairs.

Fear not; he bears an honourable mind,

meeting one evening at the tent of Sextus Tarquinius, the king's son,	
Which, in pale embers hid, lurks to aspire	
	
That kings might be espoused to more fame,	
	
O happiness enjoy'd but of a few!	
Against the golden splendour of the sun!	
Are weakly fortress'd from a world of harms.	
Or why is Collatine the publisher	
His honour, his affairs, his friends, his state,	
To quench the coal which in his liver glows.	
O rash false heat, wrapp'd in repentant cold,	
Within whose face beauty and virtue striv'd	
From Venus' doves doth challenge that fair field:	
Argued by beauty's red, and virtue's white:	
Therefore that praise which Collatine doth owe	
	
No cloudy show of stormy blustering weather	
Till sable Night, mother of Dread and Fear,	
And in her vaulty prison stows the day.	
Now leaden slumber with life's strength doth fight;	
For what they have not, that which they possess	
Is but to surfeit, and such griefs sustain,	
The death of all, and all together lost.	
And this ambitious foul infirmity,	
	
'Fair torch, burn out thy light, and lend it not	
That my posterity, sham'd with the note,	
Or sells eternity to get a toy?	
This dying virtue, this surviving shame,	
'Shameful it is;—ay, if the fact be known:	
I'll beg her love;—but she is not her own;	
O how her fear did make her colour rise!	
First red as roses that on lawn we lay,	
'And how her hand, in my hand being lock'd,	
Until her husband's welfare she did hear;	
Whereat she smiled with so sweet a cheer,	
The Roman lord marcheth to Lucrece' bed.	
Which drives the creeping thief to some regard,	
They fright him, yet he still pursues his fear.	
As each unwilling portal yields him way,	
Till every minute pays the hour his debt.	
Like little frosts that sometime threat the spring.	
	
How can they then assist me in the act?	
The blackest sin is clear'd with absolution;	
Who sees the lurking serpent steps aside;	
Swelling on either side to want his bliss;	
Her breasts, like ivory globes circled with blue,	
A pair of maiden worlds unconquered,	
The sight which makes supposed terror true.	
Quick-shifting antics, ugly in her eyes:	
Who o'er the white sheet peers her whiter chin,	
Where thou with patience must my will abide,	
What wrong, what shame, what sorrow I shall breed;	
Which, like a falcon towering in the skies,	
If thou deny, then force must work my way,	
Shalt have thy trespass cited up in rhymes,	
For marks descried in men's nativity	
His ear her prayers admits, but his heart granteth

If ever man were mov'd with woman's moans,	
Soft pity enters at an iron gate.	
From vassal actors can he wip'd away;	
That from their own misdeeds askaunce their eyes!	
Who seek to stain the ocean of thy blood.	
If all these petty ills shall change thy good,	
That done, despitefully I mean to bear thee	
This said, he sets his foot upon the light,	
When most unseen, then most doth tyrannize.	
He pens her piteous clamours in her head;	
The spots whereof could weeping purify,	
This forced league doth force a further strife;	
Devours his will, that liv'd by foul devouring.	
Till, like a jade, self-will himself doth tire.	
And then with lank and lean discolour'd cheek,	
Feeble desire, all recreant, poor, and meek,	
	
And by their mortal fault brought in subjection	
Her immortality, and made her thrall	
To living death, and pain perpetual;	
Bearing away the wound that nothing healeth,	
And he the burthen of a guilty mind.	
He like a thievish dog creeps sadly thence;	
He thence departs a heavy convertite;	
Dim register and notary of shame!	
Vast sin-concealing chaos! nurse of blame!	
Make war against proportion'd course of time!	
'With rotten damps ravish the morning air;	
And let thy misty vapours march so thick,	
	
To cross their arms and hang their heads with mine,

Yea, the illiterate, that know not how	
If that be made a theme for disputation,	
Alas, how many bear such shameful blows,

For it had been dishonour to disdain him:	
'Why should the worm intrude the maiden bud?	
'So then he hath it when he cannot use it,	
We have no good that we can say is ours,

When Tarquin did, but he was stay'd by thee.	
Eater of youth, false slave to false delight,	
To endless date of never-ending woes?	
To stamp the seal of time in aged things,	
To wake the morn, and sentinel the night,	
And smear with dust their glittering golden towers:	
To feed oblivion with decay of things,	
One poor retiring minute in an age	
Would purchase thee a thousand thousand friends,	
Let ghastly shadows his lewd eyes affright;	
And the dire thought of his committed evil	
Shape every bush a hideous shapeless devil.	
	
	
His time of folly and his time of sport:	
Such wretched hands such wretched blood should spill:	
	
For greatest scandal waits on greatest state.	
'Out, idle words, servants to shallow fools!	
Kill both thyself and her for yielding so.'	
To make more vent for passage of her breath;	
I fear'd by Tarquin's falchion to be slain,	
Yet for the self-same purpose seek a knife:	
As from a mountain-spring that feeds a dale,	
Holds disputation with each thing she views,	
The little birds that tune their morning's joy	
Relish your nimble notes to pleasing ears;	
	
	
But with my body my poor soul's pollution?	
They that lose half with greater patience bear it	
Who, having two sweet babes, when death takes one,	
'My body or my soul, which was the dearer,	
If in this blemish'd fort I make some hole	
Have heard the cause of my untimely death;	
	
And all my fame that lives disburs'd be	
How was I overseen that thou shalt see it!	
For fleet-wing'd duty with thought's feathers flies.	
But as the earth doth weep, the sun being set,	
Which makes the maid weep like the dewy night.	
No more than wax shall be accounted evil,	
Poor women's faces are their own faults' books.	
The precedent whereof in Lucrece view,	
	
Those tears from thee, that down thy cheeks are raining?	
If tears could help, mine own would do me good.	
Yet with the fault I thus far can dispense;	
	
For more it is than I can well express:	
'Go, get me hither paper, ink, and pen—	
At last she thus begins:—'Thou worthy lord	
My woes are tedious, though my words are brief.'	
Lest he should hold it her own gross abuse,	
From that suspicion which the world my might bear her.	
And sorrow ebbs, being blown with wind of words.	
Her letter now is seal'd, and on it writ	
As lagging fowls before the northern blast.	
Speed more than speed but dull and slow she deems:	
Imagine every eye beholds their blame;	
Of spirit, life, and bold audacity.	
That she her plaints a little while doth stay,	
Of skilful painting, made for Priam's Troy;	
For Helen's rape the city to destroy,	
Threat'ning cloud-kissing Ilion with annoy;	
	
Of physiognomy might one behold!	
All jointly listening, but with several graces,	
And from the walls of strong-besieged Troy	
(Like bright things stain'd) a kind of heavy fear,	
They join, and shoot their foam at Simois' banks.	
But none where all distress and dolour dwell'd,	
Her blue blood, chang'd to black in every vein,	
	
And bitter words to ban her cruel foes:	
The painter was no god to lend her those;	
And therefore Lucrece swears he did her wrong,	
To give her so much grief, and not a tongue.	
'Poor instrument,' quoth she, 'without a sound,	
And with my knife scratch out the angry eyes	
	
Here manly Hector faints, here Troilus swounds;	
Troy had been bright with fame and not with fire.'	
That piteous looks to Phrygian shepherds lent:	
To hide deceit, and give the harmless show	
That blushing red no guilty instance gave,	
And therein so ensconc'd his secret evil,	
That jealousy itself cold not mistrust	
Or blot with hell-born sin such saint-like forms.	
When their glass fell wherein they view'd their faces.	
And chid the painter for his wondrous skill;	
'It cannot be,' quoth she, 'that so much guile'—	
So did I Tarquin; so my Troy did perish.	
Priam, why art thou old and yet not wise?	
Short time seems long in sorrow's sharp sustaining.	
Being from the feeling of her own grief brought	
To think their dolour others have endur'd.	
Brings home his lord and other company;	
And round about her tear-distained eye	
Her eyes, though sod in tears, look'd red and raw,	
Three times with sighs she gives her sorrow fire,	
Her honour is ta'en prisoner by the foe;	
While Collatine and his consorted lords	
	
	
No rightful plea might plead for justice there:	
To drown one woe, one pair of weeping eyes.	
	
'And for my sake, when I might charm thee so,	
For she that was thy Lucrece,—now attend me;	
Be suddenly revenged on my foe,	
	
'But ere I name him, you fair lords,' quoth she,	
Longing to hear the hateful foe bewray'd.	
	
Of hard misfortune, carv'd in it with tears.	
Of that polluted prison where it breath'd:	
Of that black blood a watery rigol goes,	
Which seems to weep upon the tainted place:	
And ever since, as pitying Lucrece' woes,	
If in the child the father's image lies,	
If children pre-decease progenitors,	
But now that fair fresh mirror, dim and old,	
And bids Lucretius give his sorrow place;	
Hath serv'd a dumb arrest upon his tongue;	
At last it rains, and busy winds give o'er:	
Who should weep most, for daughter or for wife.	
My sorrow's interest; let no mourner say	
Brutus, who pluck'd the knife from Lucrece' side,	
	
'Why, Collatine, is woe the cure for woe?	
By our strong arms from forth her fair streets chas'd.	
And kiss'd the fatal knife, to end his vow;	
He doth again repeat, and that they swore.	
	
_Vilia miretur vulgus; mihi flavus Apollo	
Pocula Castalia plena ministret aqua._	
HENRY WRIOTHESLEY,  EARL OF SOUTHAMPTON,	
for choosing so strong a prop to support so weak a burthen: only, if	
your honour seem but pleased, I account myself highly praised, and vow	
Rose-cheek’d Adonis tried him to the chase;	
	
	
Earth’s sovereign salve to do a goddess good:         28	
And kissing speaks, with lustful language broken,	
Even as an empty eagle, sharp by fast,	
Panting he lies, and breatheth in her face.	
And calls it heavenly moisture, air of grace,         64	
Rain added to a river that is rank	
Strong-temper’d steel his stronger strength obey’d,	
Though mine be not so fair, yet are they red,        116	
Then why not lips on lips, since eyes in eyes?     120	
O’erworn, despised, rheumatic, and cold,	
Thick-sighted, barren, lean, and lacking juice,      136	
Then mightst thou pause, for then I were not for thee;	
My smooth moist hand, were it with thy hand felt,	
Or like a fairy, trip upon the green,	
	
	
Nay more than flint, for stone at rain relenteth:    200	
And one for int’rest, if thou wilt have twain.	
	
Then be my deer, since I am such a park,           239	
At this Adonis smiles as in disdain,	
Why there love liv’d, and there he could not die.	
Sometime he trots, as if he told the steps,	
He sees his love, and nothing else he sees,	
Look, what a horse should have he did not lack,	
For through his mane and tail the high wind sings,	
When lo the unback’d breeder, full of fear,         320	
So of concealed sorrow may be said,	
To note the fighting conflict of her hue,	
And like a lowly lover down she kneels;	
As apt as new-fall’n snow takes any dint.	
So white a friend engirts so white a foe:            364	
This beauteous combat, wilful and unwilling,	
“O fairest mover on this mortal round,               368	
For one sweet look thy help I would assure thee,	
	
	
Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.     396	
	
To take advantage on presented joy,	
O learn to love, the lesson is but plain,	
Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flatt’ry;	
“Had I no eyes but ears, my ears would love          433	
Wrack to the seaman, tempest to the field,	
Or as the berry breaks before it staineth,           460	
Or like the deadly bullet of a gun,	
	
For looks kill love, and love by looks reviveth;     464	
Claps her pale cheek, till clapping makes it red.  468	
For sharply he did think to reprehend her,	
For on the grass she lies as she were slain,	
To mend the hurt that his unkindness marr’d:	
Oh never let their crimson liveries wear,	
Set thy seal manual on my wax-red lips.            516	
	
Her arms do lend his neck a sweet embrace;	
And yields at last to every light impression?	
The poor fool prays her that he may depart:	
His eyes like glow-worms shine when he doth fret;	
Being mov’d, he strikes whate’er is in his way,	
As fearful of him, part, through whom he rushes.	
	
Beauty hath naught to do with such foul fiends:	
Within my bosom, whereon thou dost lie,	
“For where love reigns, disturbing jealousy          649	
Distemp’ring gentle love in his desire,	
This canker that eats up love’s tender spring,       656	
And on thy well-breath’d horse keep with thy hounds.	
Mark the poor wretch, to overshoot his troubles      680	
And sometime sorteth with a herd of deer;	
Then do they spend their mouths: echo replies,	
“Leave me, and then the story aptly ends:            716	
The night is spent.” “Why, what of that?” quoth she.	
For stealing moulds from heaven, that were divine;	
Are on the sudden wasted, thaw’d and done,	
	
Since sweating lust on earth usurp’d his name;	
Therefore, in sadness, now I will away;	
	
She marking them, begins a wailing note,	
For lovers’ hours are long, though seeming short,	
Wreath’d up in fatal folds just in his way,	
Appals her senses, and her spirit confounds.	
For now she knows it is no gentle chase,	
Like soldiers when their captain once doth yield,	
Till cheering up her senses sore dismay’d,           896	
And with that word, she spied the hunted boar.     900	
	
Look how the world’s poor people are amazed          925	
Why hast thou cast into eternal sleeping	
Now nature cares not for thy mortal vigour,	
Here overcome, as one full of despair,	
But through the flood-gates breaks the silver rain,	
Not to believe, and yet too credulous;	
Thy weal and woe are both of them extremes;	
Now she unweaves the web that she hath wrought,	
Imperious supreme of all mortal things.            996	
Grief hath two tongues, and never woman yet,	
Where they resign their office and their light	
And never wound the heart with looks again;	
Her eyes are mad, that they have wept till now.	
His face seems twain, each several limb is doubled,	
And yet,” quoth she, “behold two Adons dead!	
My sighs are blown away, my salt tears gone,	
To recreate himself when he hath sung,	
If he did see his face, why then I know	
My youth with his; the more am I accurst.”          1120	
With this she falleth in the place she stood,	
She lifts the coffer-lids that close his eyes,	
	
Two glasses where herself herself beheld            1129	
And every beauty robb’d of his effect.              1132	
“Since thou art dead, lo here I prophesy,	
And most deceiving when it seems most just;         1156	
Put fear to valour, courage to the coward.	
Comparing it to her Adonis’ breath;                 1172	
“Poor flower,” quoth she, “this was thy father’s guise,	
Thou art the next of blood, and ’tis thy right:     1184	
And yokes her silver doves; by whose swift aid	
Their mistress mounted through the empty skies,
