THE SONNETS	
	
Thou that art now the world’s fresh ornament,	
And, tender churl, mak’st waste in niggarding:	
Pity the world, or else this glutton be,	
	
3	
Now is the time that face should form another,	
Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.	
So great a sum of sums yet canst not live?	
What acceptable audit canst thou leave?	
	
	
Serving with looks his sacred majesty,	
Attending on his golden pilgrimage:	
That thou consum’st thy self in single life?	
No love toward others in that bosom sits	
That on himself such murd’rous shame commits.	
10	
Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?	
Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard:	
And yet methinks I have astronomy,	
But not to tell of good, or evil luck,	
Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons’ quality,	
Whereon the stars in secret influence comment.	
When I perceive that men as plants increase,	
With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?	
17	
If it were filled with your most high deserts?	
Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts:	
The age to come would say this poet lies,	
But were some child of yours alive that time,	
	
By chance, or nature’s changing course untrimmed:	
19	
Devouring Time blunt thou the lion’s paws,	
Which steals men’s eyes and women’s souls amazeth.	
And for a woman wert thou first created,	
Mine be thy love and thy love’s use their treasure.	
For all that beauty that doth cover thee,	
As I not for my self, but for thee will,	
Bearing thy heart which I will keep so chary	
As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.	
Thou gav’st me thine not to give back again.	
	
	
As an unperfect actor on the stage,	
Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,	
The perfect ceremony of love’s rite,	
For through the painter must you see his skill,	
Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done,	
Is from the book of honour razed quite,	
Where I may not remove nor be removed.	
To thee I send this written embassage	
And puts apparel on my tattered loving,	
Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,	
	
And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:	
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,	
And with old woes new wail my dear time’s waste:	
31	
And there reigns love and all love’s loving parts,	
And thou (all they) hast all the all of me.	
When that churl death my bones with dust shall cover	
But since he died and poets better prove,	
Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,	
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride,	
And make me travel forth without my cloak,	
	
And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.	
	
And by a part of all thy glory live:	
	
How can my muse want subject to invent	
And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth	
What can mine own praise to mine own self bring:	
Even for this, let us divided live,	
Ay me, but yet thou mightst my seat forbear,	
That she hath thee is of my wailing chief,	
Thou dost love her, because thou know’st I love her,	
And losing her, my friend hath found that loss,	
And both for my sake lay on me this cross,	
For all the day they view things unrespected,	
And darkly bright, are bright in dark directed.	
In tender embassy of love to thee,	
Until life’s composition be recured,	
My heart, mine eye the freedom of that right,	
The clear eye’s moiety, and the dear heart’s part.	
Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,	
Which heavily he answers with a groan,	
Thus can my love excuse the slow offence,	
Till I return of posting is no need.	
Then can no horse with my desire keep pace,	
Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope,	
Being had to triumph, being lacked to hope.	
	
The living record of your memory.	
The spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness:	
Which parts the shore, where two contracted new,	
O let me suffer (being at your beck)	
That you your self may privilage your time	
Your self to pardon of self-doing crime.	
	
Hath been before, how are our brains beguiled,	
In sequent toil all forwards do contend.	
Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.	
Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye,	
’Tis thee (my self) that for my self I praise,	
	
When sometime lofty towers I see down-rased,	
When I have seen the hungry ocean gain	
Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,	
But weep to have, that which it fears to lose.	
65	
O none, unless this miracle have might,	
Why should false painting imitate his cheek,	
Why should poor beauty indirectly seek,	
To live a second life on second head,	
Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.	
They look into the beauty of thy mind,	
The soil is this, that thou dost common grow.	
	
That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect,	
The ornament of beauty is suspect,	
71	
If thinking on me then should make you woe.	
O if (I say) you look upon this verse,	
That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,	
This thou perceiv’st, which makes thy love more strong,	
The prey of worms, my body being dead,	
	
So far from variation or quick change?	
And keep invention in a noted weed,	
Spending again what is already spent:	
	
To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.	
	
In others’ works thou dost but mend the style,	
He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word,	
O how I faint when I of you do write,	
Your monument shall be my gentle verse,	
Which eyes not yet created shall o’er-read,	
	
Of their fair subject, blessing every book.	
What strained touches rhetoric can lend,	
That to his subject lends not some small glory,	
Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,	
Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?	
For how do I hold thee but by thy granting,	
Comes home again, on better judgement making.	
Be absent from thy walks and in my tongue,	
To linger out a purposed overthrow.	
At first the very worst of fortune’s might.	
	
Richer than wealth, prouder than garments’ costs,	
	
Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie,	
Happy to have thy love, happy to die!	
93	
In many’s looks, the false heart’s history	
That do not do the thing, they most do show,	
For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds,	
How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame,	
And all things turns to fair, that eyes can see!	
	
	
Thou mak’st faults graces, that to thee resort:	
As on the finger of a throned queen,	
How many lambs might the stern wolf betray,	
How like a winter hath my absence been	
The teeming autumn big with rich increase,	
Like widowed wombs after their lords’ decease:	
	
Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.	
The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,	
More flowers I noted, yet I none could see,	
	
Spend’st thou thy fury on some worthless song,	
	
102	
I love not less, though less the show appear,	
Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,	
Therefore like her, I sometime hold my tongue:	
	
Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,	
Fair, kind, and true, varying to other words,	
Which three till now, never kept seat in one.	
	
Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul,	
Incertainties now crown themselves assured,	
Nothing sweet boy, but yet like prayers divine,	
Like him that travels I return again,	
Now all is done, have what shall have no end,	
Pity me then dear friend, and I assure ye,	
And that which governs me to go about,	
Doth part his function, and is partly blind,	
For if it see the rud’st or gentlest sight,	
The crow, or dove, it shapes them to your feature.	
My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue.	
	
To give full growth to that which still doth grow.	
116	
It is the star to every wand’ring bark,	
Whose worth’s unknown, although his height be taken.	
Love’s not Time’s fool, though rosy lips and cheeks	
Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day,	
	
With eager compounds we our palate urge,	
And sick of welfare found a kind of meetness,	
Thus policy in love t’ anticipate	
Applying fears to hopes, and hopes to fears,	
How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted	
In the distraction of this madding fever!	
So I return rebuked to my content,	
120	
Needs must I under my transgression bow,	
And I a tyrant have no leisure taken	
And soon to you, as you to me then tendered	
Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.	
	
I may be straight though they themselves be bevel;	
Which shall above that idle rank remain	
To keep an adjunct to remember thee	
	
Thy registers and thee I both defy,	
I will be true despite thy scythe and thee.	
	
Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gathered.	
It fears not policy that heretic,	
	
Therefore my mistress’ eyes are raven black,	
128	
On purpose laid to make the taker mad.	
130	
And in some perfumes is there more delight,	
As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel;	
Thy face hath not the power to make love groan;	
Thy black is fairest in my judgment’s place.	
Have put on black, and loving mourners be,	
Me from my self thy cruel eye hath taken,	
Of him, my self, and thee I am forsaken,	
A torment thrice three-fold thus to be crossed:	
So now I have confessed that he is thine,	
Shall will in others seem right gracious,	
One will of mine to make thy large will more.	
	
Will will fulfil the treasure of thy love,	
Thou blind fool Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,	
138	
Unlearned in the world’s false subtleties.	
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,	
On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed:	
	
	
Use power with power, and slay me not by art,	
Yet do not so, but since I am near slain,	
	
As testy sick men when their deaths be near,	
Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,	
That I may not be so, nor thou belied,	
	
But my five wits, nor my five senses can	
Only my plague thus far I count my gain,	
Be it lawful I love thee as thou lov’st those,	
One of her feathered creatures broke away,	
Sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch	
144	
Wooing his purity with her foul pride.	
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,	
Hath left me, and I desperate now approve,	
For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,	
Do I not think on thee when I forgot	
But love hate on for now I know thy mind,	
Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,	
That in my mind thy worst all best exceeds?	
	
Then gentle cheater urge not my amiss,

Holds idleness your subject, I should take you	
Eye well to you. Your honour calls you hence;	
Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly,

To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet	
So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd

DROMIO OF EPHESUS twin brothers, and attendants on	
Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,	
Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;

In Syracuse was I born, and wed	
From whom my absence was not six months old,	
The sailors sought for safety by our boat,	
Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this.

Of whom I hope to make much benefit;

What now? How chance thou art return'd so soon?	
But we, that know what 'tis to fast and pray,	
The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not.	
But not a thousand marks between you both.	
	
They say this town is full of cozenage;	
I'll to the Centaur to go seek this slave.

Until I know this sure uncertainty,	
LUCIANA. Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner.	
They'll suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue.	
Come, sir, to dinner. Dromio, keep the gate.	
Husband, I'll dine above with you to-day,	
Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter.	
Come, sister. Dromio, play the porter well.	
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell?	
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, shall I be porter at the gate?	
	
	
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know.	
That you beat me at the mart I have your hand to show;	
May answer my good will and your good welcome here.

Be it for nothing but to spite my wife-	
I'll knock elsewhere, to see if they'll disdain me.

Or, if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth;

Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;	
To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears.	
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know.	
LUCIANA. It is a fault that springeth from your eye.	
LUCIANA. Gaze where you should, and that will clear your sight.	
It is thyself, mine own self's better part;

PINCH. Mistress, both man and master is possess'd;	
They must be bound, and laid in some dark room.	
ADRIANA. Dissembling villain, thou speak'st false in both.	
PINCH. More company! The fiend is strong within him.	
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. What, will you murder me? Thou gaoler, thou,

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?	
Enter ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the COURTEZAN, and OTHERS	
	
And bear him home for his recovery.	
ADRIANA. This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,	
ABBESS. Haply in private.	
In bed, he slept not for my urging it;	
In company, I often glanced it;	
The venom clamours of a jealous woman	
But moody and dull melancholy,	
And at her heels a huge infectious troop

COURTEZAN. He did; and from my finger snatch'd that ring.

In sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow,

GLOUCESTER and EXETER	
Do breed love's settled passions in my heart;	
So am I driven by breath of her renown

In our opinions she should be preferr'd;	
With any passion of inflaming love,	
That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come	
But I will rule both her, the King, and realm.          Exit

SIR HUMPHREY STAFFORD	
Lords, Ladies, and Attendants; Petitioners, Aldermen, a Herald,	
	
GLOUCESTER, SALISBURY, WARWICK, and CARDINAL BEAUFORT, on the one side;	
	
I had in charge at my depart for France,	
KING HENRY. Her sight did ravish, but her grace in speech,	
Such is the fulness of my heart's content.	
Early and late, debating to and fro	
And had his Highness in his infancy	
For France, 'tis ours; and we will keep it still.	
WARWICK. For grief that they are past recovery;	
My sword should shed hot blood, mine eyes no tears.	
Deliver'd up again with peaceful words?	
It was the pleasure of my lord the King.	
Clapping their hands, and crying with loud voice	
We'll quickly hoise Duke Humphrey from his seat.	
CARDINAL. This weighty business will not brook delay;	
Yet let us watch the haughty cardinal;	
BUCKINGHAM. Or thou or I, Somerset, will be Protector,	
Did bear him like a noble gentleman.	
Hath won the greatest favour of the commons,	
And common profit of his country!	
And would have kept so long as breath did last.	
Stands on a tickle point now they are gone.	
'Tis thine they give away, and not their own.	
Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage,	
Ready to starve and dare not touch his own.	
Unto the prince's heart of Calydon.	
And when I spy advantage, claim the crown,	
Watch thou and wake, when others be asleep,	
Till Henry, surfeiting in joys of love	
With his new bride and England's dear-bought queen,	
And in my standard bear the arms of York,	
SCENE II. The DUKE OF GLOUCESTER'S house	
This was my dream; what it doth bode God knows.	
DUCHESS. Tut, this was nothing but an argument	
In the cathedral church of Westminster,	
Art thou not second woman in the realm,	
GLOUCESTER. Nay, be not angry; I am pleas'd again.	
Enter a MESSENGER	
You do prepare to ride unto Saint Albans,	
Where as the King and Queen do mean to hawk.	
GLOUCESTER. I go. Come, Nell, thou wilt ride with us?	
I would remove these tedious stumbling-blocks	
Where are you there, Sir John? Nay, fear not, man,	
DUCHESS. What say'st thou? Majesty! I am but Grace.	
And will they undertake to do me good?	
As by your Grace shall be propounded him	
Have hired me to undermine the Duchess,	
Sort how it will, I shall have gold for all.            Exit	
QUEEN. What say'st thou? Did the Duke of York say he was rightful	
Am I a queen in title and in style,

And set the triple crown upon his head;	
That were a state fit for his holiness.	
Your Highness came to England, so will I

And at his pleasure will resign my place.	
Are lank and lean with thy extortions.	
KING HENRY. Sweet aunt, be quiet; 'twas against her will.	
I come to talk of commonwealth affairs.	
As I in duty love my king and country!	
But to the matter that we have in hand:	
Did never traitor in the land commit.	
SUFFOLK. Please it your Majesty, this is the man	
KING HENRY. Say, man, were these thy words?	
Let Somerset be Regent o'er the French,	
be the last of the next month.

And spirits walk and ghosts break up their graves-

Injurious Duke, that threatest where's no cause.	
Exeunt, above, DUCHESS and HUME, guarded; below,	
But him outlive, and die a violent death.'	
Safer shall he be upon the sandy plains

Thither go these news as fast as horse can carry them-	
BUCKINGHAM. Your Grace shall give me leave, my Lord of York,	
Enter a serving-man	
An't like your lordly Lord's Protectorship.

KING HENRY. I prithee, peace,	
Protector, see to't well; protect yourself.	
KING HENRY. The winds grow high; so do your stomachs, lords.	
Gives light in darkness, comfort in despair!

You go about to torture me in vain.	
BEADLE. I will, my lord. Come on, sirrah; off with your doublet

QUEEN. It made me laugh to see the villain run.	
CARDINAL. And so, my Lord Protector, by this means	
Heaping confusion on their own heads thereby!	
I banish her my bed and company	
And poise the cause in justice' equal scales,	
	
Which is infallible, to England's crown.	
Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons;	
Was John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster;	
Seiz'd on the realm, depos'd the rightful king,	
SALISBURY. But William of Hatfield died without an heir.	
I claim the crown, had issue Philippe, a daughter,	
Roger had issue, Edmund, Anne, and Eleanor.	
The fourth son: York claims it from the third.	
And in thy sons, fair slips of such a stock.	
BOTH. Long live our sovereign Richard, England's King!	
At Buckingham, and all the crew of them,	
SALISBURY. My lord, break we off; we know your mind at full.	
YORK. And, Nevil, this I do assure myself,	
Richard shall live to make the Earl of Warwick	
In sight of God and us, your guilt is great;	
This is the day appointed for the combat;

SERVING-MAN. Ten, my lord.	
With envious looks, laughing at thy shame,	
Enter the DUCHESS OF GLOUCESTER in a white sheet,	
Trowest thou that e'er I'll look upon the world	
To take her with him to the Isle of Man.	
Because I wish'd this world's eternity.	
	
And if we did but glance a far-off look	
When every one will give the time of day,	
But great men tremble when the lion roars,	
Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears,	
Or be admitted to your Highness' Council.	
Now 'tis the spring, and weeds are shallow-rooted;	
My Lord of Suffolk, Buckingham, and York,	
I think I should have told your Grace's tale.	
Or if he were not privy to those faults,	
BUCKINGHAM. Tut, these are petty faults to faults unknown	
KING HENRY. My lords, at once: the care you have of us,	
As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove:	
For he's inclin'd as is the ravenous wolf.	
	
KING HENRY. Welcome, Lord Somerset. What news from France?	
YORK. [Aside] Cold news for me; for I had hope of France	
Enter GLOUCESTER	
GLOUCESTER. I say no more than truth, so help me God!	
Strange tortures for offenders, never heard of,	
I never gave them condign punishment.	
Above the felon or what trespass else.	
And here commit you to my Lord Cardinal	
And charity chas'd hence by rancour's hand;	
GLOUCESTER. Far truer spoke than meant: I lose indeed.	
Whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes;	
Even so, remorseless, have they borne him hence;	
Even so myself bewails good Gloucester's case	
SUFFOLK. But, in my mind, that were no policy:	
To guard the chicken from a hungry kite	
Who being accus'd a crafty murderer,	
By nature prov'd an enemy to the flock,	
For things are often spoke and seldom meant;	
And I'll provide his executioner-	
It skills not greatly who impugns our doom.	
CARDINAL. A breach that craves a quick expedient stop!	
QUEEN. Nay then, this spark will prove a raging fire,	
For there I'll ship them all for Ireland.	
And find no harbour in a royal heart.	
Faster than spring-time show'rs comes thought on thought,	
To make commotion, as full well he can,	
Oppose himself against a troop of kerns,	
And given me notice of their villainies.	
SUFFOLK. Away! be gone.                       Exeunt MURDERERS	
Sound trumpets. Enter the KING, the QUEEN,	
Proceed no straiter 'gainst our uncle Gloucester	
Than from true evidence, of good esteem,	
KING HENRY. I thank thee, Meg; these words content me much.	
How now! Why look'st thou pale? Why tremblest thou?	
CARDINAL. God's secret judgment! I did dream to-night	
SUFFOLK. He doth revive again; madam, be patient.	
KING HENRY. What, doth my Lord of Suffolk comfort me?	
Hide not thy poison with such sug'red words;	
Their touch affrights me as a serpent's sting.	
Yet do not go away; come, basilisk,	
In life but double death,'now Gloucester's dead.	
Although the Duke was enemy to him,	
And all to have the noble Duke alive.	
Be poisonous too, and kill thy forlorn Queen.	
Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucester's tomb?	
Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock?	
I stood upon the hatches in the storm;	
And call'd them blind and dusky spectacles	
And care not who they sting in his revenge.	
Myself have calm'd their spleenful mutiny	
Exit SALISBURY with the commons	
For judgment only doth belong to Thee.	
With twenty thousand kisses and to drain	
What were it but to make my sorrow greater?	
	
For with his soul fled all my worldly solace,	
With that dread King that took our state upon Him	
SUFFOLK. A dreadful oath, sworn with a solemn tongue!	
Being all descended to the labouring heart,	
Which with the heart there cools, and ne'er returneth	
To blush and beautify the cheek again.	
His eye-balls further out than when he liv'd,	
And tugg'd for life, and was by strength subdu'd.	
The least of all these signs were probable.	
And sees fast by a butcher with an axe,	
Pernicious blood-sucker of sleeping men.	
[A noise within]	
SUFFOLK. The trait'rous Warwick, with the men of Bury,	
Free from a stubborn opposite intent,	
It were but necessary you were wak'd,	
Whose far unworthy deputy I am,	
Thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath.	
With full as many signs of deadly hate,	
Or like an overcharged gun, recoil,	
As one that surfeits thinking on a want.	
	
QUEEN. Go tell this heavy message to the King.       Exit VAUX	
It is applied to a deathful wound.	
Enter the KING, SALISBURY, and WARWICK, to the CARDINAL in bed	
KING HENRY. Ah, what a sign it is of evil life	
Died he not in his bed? Where should he die?	
Can I make men live, whe'er they will or no?	
I'll give a thousand pound to look upon him.	
He hath no eyes, the dust hath blinded them.	
Give me some drink; and bid the apothecary	
Is crept into the bosom of the sea;	
That drag the tragic melancholy night;	
SUFFOLK. Stay, Whitmore, for thy prisoner is a prince,	
And duly waited for my coming forth.	
This hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf,	
WHITMORE. Speak, Captain, shall I stab the forlorn swain?	
SUFFOLK. Thou dar'st not, for thy own.	
Unto the daughter of a worthless king,	
Having neither subject, wealth, nor diadem.	
And, like ambitious Sylla, overgorg'd

Cheer'd up the drooping army, and himself,	
But is your Grace dead, my Lord of Somerset?	
Before I see thee seated in that throne	
I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close.

Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.	
By words or blows here let us win our right.

Even in the chair of state! Belike he means,	
Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father;	
Thou factious Duke of York, descend my throne	
March'd through the city to the palace gates.	
Thy kinsmen, and thy friends, I'll have more lives	
YORK. Will you we show our title to the crown?	
YORK. Sons, peace!	
KING HENRY. Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,	
No; first shall war unpeople this my realm;	
For Richard, in the view of many lords,	
But that the next heir should succeed and reign.	
NORTHUMBERLAND. Thou art deceiv'd. 'Tis not thy southern power	
CLIFFORD. King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,	
WARWICK. What good is this to England and himself!

And yet the King not privy to my drift,	
But, stay. What news? Why com'st thou in such post?

But this I know- they have demean'd themselves	
And were I strong, I would not shun their fury.	
Enter QUEEN MARGARET, CLIFFORD, NORTHUMBERLAND,	
And in thy thought o'errun my former time;	
[They lay hands on YORK, who struggles]	
So true men yield, with robbers so o'er-match'd.	
That valiant Clifford with his rapier's point	
And if thine eyes can water for his death,	
Alas, poor York! but that I hate thee deadly,	
Hold you his hands whilst I do set it on.	
Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman.	
And every drop cries vengeance for his death	
See, ruthless queen, a hapless father's tears.	
This cloth thou dipp'dst in blood of my sweet boy,	
And I with tears do wash the blood away.	
My soul to heaven, my blood upon your heads!	
Think but upon the wrong he did us all,	
A march. Enter EDWARD, RICHARD, and their power	
And watch'd him how he singled Clifford forth.	
As doth a lion in a herd of neat;	
So far'd our father with his enemies;	
EDWARD. O, speak no more! for I have heard too much.	
MESSENGER. Environed he was with many foes,	
Against the Greeks that would have ent'red Troy.	
But Hercules himself must yield to odds;	
By many hands your father was subdu'd;	
They took his head, and on the gates of York	
They set the same; and there it doth remain,	
The flow'r of Europe for his chivalry;	
For chair and dukedom, throne and kingdom, say:	
	
Which held thee dearly as his soul's redemption	
After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,	
I cannot judge; but, to conclude with truth,	
Their weapons like to lightning came and went:	
Or like an idle thresher with a flail,	
Lord George your brother, Norfolk, and myself,	
And wring the awful sceptre from his fist,	
'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak.	
With Clifford and the haught Northumberland,	
Will but amount to five and twenty thousand,	
And he that throws not up his cap for joy	
RICHARD. Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel,	
CLIFFORD,	
Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy	
Thou, being a king, bless'd with a goodly son,	
Than in possession any jot of pleasure.	
PRINCE OF WALES. My gracious father, by your kingly leave,	
MESSENGER. Royal commanders, be in readiness;	
EDWARD. Now, perjur'd Henry, wilt thou kneel for grace	
Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king?	
WARWICK. What say'st thou, Henry? Wilt thou yield the crown?	
NORTHUMBERLAND. No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay.	
Upon that Clifford, that cruel child-killer.	
As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland;	
A thousand men have broke their fasts to-day	
Whose father bears the title of a king-	
Sham'st thou not, knowing whence thou art extraught,	
To make this shameless callet know herself.	
And heap'd sedition on his crown at home.	
Had slipp'd our claim until another age.	
Exeunt	
	
GEORGE. Our hap is lost, our hope but sad despair;	
What counsel give you? Whither shall we fly?	
Enter RICHARD	
And ere my knee rise from the earth's cold face	
And give them leave to fly that will not stay,	
And call them pillars that will stand to us;	
As victors wear at the Olympian games.	
For yet is hope of life and victory.	
RICHARD. Now, Clifford, I have singled thee alone.	
Wert thou environ'd with a brazen wall.	
	
Can neither call it perfect day nor night.	
Forc'd to retire by fury of the wind.	
Now one the better, then another best;	
Yet neither conqueror nor conquered.	
How many makes the hour full complete,	
So many years ere I shall shear the fleece:	
Gives not the hawthorn bush a sweeter shade	
O yes, it doth; a thousand-fold it doth.	
And to conclude: the shepherd's homely curds,	
His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade,	
All which secure and sweetly he enjoys,	
His viands sparkling in a golden cup,	
May yet ere night yield both my life and them	
Wither one rose, and let the other flourish!	
Shed seas of tears, and ne'er be satisfied!	
KING HENRY. Was ever king so griev'd for subjects' woe?	
Exit with the body	
KING HENRY. Nay, take me with thee, good sweet Exeter.	
Not that I fear to stay, but love to go	
Which, whiles it lasted, gave King Henry light.	
And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?	
And, Henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do,	
Giving no ground unto the house of York,	
They never then had sprung like summer flies;	
But think you, lords, that Clifford fled with them?	
RICHARD. Revoke that doom of mercy, for 'tis Clifford;	
Who not contented that he lopp'd the branch	
WARWICK. From off the gates of York fetch down the head,	
RICHARD. What, not an oath? Nay, then the world goes hard	
And then to Brittany I'll cross the sea	
To effect this marriage, so it please my lord.	
And George, of Clarence; Warwick, as ourself,	
To see these honours in possession.                   Exeunt

What love, thinkst thou, I sue so much to get?	
For by that loss I will not purchase them.

GLOUCESTER. The ghostly father now hath done his shrift.	
GLOUCESTER. By so much is the wonder in extremes.	
That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring

Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner?	
Shall cross the seas and bid false Edward battle:	
That if our Queen and this young Prince agree,	
Exeunt all but WARWICK	
Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me,	
and others. Four stand on one side, and four on the other	
KING EDWARD. Now, brother of Clarence, how like you our choice	
Whom God hath join'd together; ay, and 'twere pity	
To sunder them that yoke so well together.	
Should not become my wife and England's Queen.	
Speak freely what you think.	
Let us be back'd with God, and with the seas	
CLARENCE. Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir	
KING EDWARD. Alas, poor Clarence! Is it for a wife	
That thou art malcontent? I will provide thee.	
And not be tied unto his brother's will.	
That I was not ignoble of descent:	
So your dislikes, to whom I would be pleasing,	
But what said Lady Bona to my marriage?	
But what said Warwick to these injuries?	
Than all the rest, discharg'd me with these words:	
Well, I will arm me, being thus forewarn'd.	
My thoughts aim at a further matter; I	
Stay not for the love of Edward but the crown.	
KING EDWARD. Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick!	
Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,	
That I may never have you in suspect.	
KING EDWARD. Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us?	
WARWICK. Then, gentle Clarence, welcome unto Warwick;	
Hath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love;	
You that will follow me to this attempt,	
Never to lie and take his natural rest	
If Warwick be so near as men report.	
That his chief followers lodge in towns about him,	
WARWICK. This is his tent; and see where stand his guard.	
KING EDWARD. The Duke! Why, Warwick, when we parted,	
WARWICK. Ay, but the case is alter'd.	
Then I degraded you from being King,	
Nor how to be contented with one wife,	
I'll follow you and tell what answer	
Lewis and the Lady Bona send to him.	
	
He hath good usage and great liberty;	
GLOUCESTER. Well guess'd, believe me; for that was my meaning.	
KING EDWARD. Huntsman, what say'st thou? Wilt thou go along?	
Flourish. Enter KING HENRY, CLARENCE, WARWICK, SOMERSET, young HENRY,	
Have shaken Edward from the regal seat	
I then crave pardon of your Majesty.	
May not be punish'd with my thwarting stars,	
And in devotion spend my latter days,	
And all his lands and goods confiscated.	
KING HENRY. But, with the first of all your chief affairs,	
His looks are full of peaceful majesty;	
His hand to wield a sceptre; and himself	
Come therefore, let's about it speedily.              Exeunt	
Yet thus far fortune maketh us amends,	
By fair or foul means we must enter in,

And shut the gates for safety of ourselves,	
HASTINGS. Why, Master Mayor, why stand you in a doubt?	
[He descends]	
March. Enter MONTGOMERY with drum and soldiers	
MONTGOMERY. To help King Edward in his time of storm,	
I came to serve a king and not a duke.	
And when the morning sun shall raise his car	
With hasty Germans and blunt Hollanders,	
Which, being suffer'd, rivers cannot quench.	
Shall rest in London till we come to him.	
KING HENRY. Farewell, my Hector and my Troy's true hope.	
adieu.	
KING HENRY. Sweet Oxford, and my loving Montague,	
WARWICK. Farewell, sweet lords; let's meet at Coventry.	
KING HENRY. Here at the palace will I rest a while.	
	
Enter KING EDWARD, GLOUCESTER, and soldiers	
	
SOMERVILLE. At Southam I did leave him with his forces,	
and soldiers	
KING EDWARD. Now, Warwick, wilt thou ope the city gates,	
WARWICK. Is not a dukedom, sir, a goodly gift?	
GLOUCESTER. Alas, that Warwick had no more forecast,	
And ten to one you'll meet him in the Tower.	
Than bear so low a sail to strike to thee.	
Stand we in good array, for they no doubt	
We'll quietly rouse the traitors in the same.	
	
WARWICK. And lo where George of Clarence sweeps along,	
I will not ruinate my father's house,	
I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe;	
As I will meet thee, if thou stir abroad-	
For I will henceforth be no more unconstant.	
The Queen from France hath brought a puissant power;	
KING EDWARD. Thus far our fortune keeps an upward course,	
I spy a black, suspicious, threat'ning cloud	
GLOUCESTER. The Queen is valued thirty thousand strong,	
And Richard but a ragged fatal rock?	
Say you can swim; alas, 'tis but a while!	
Why, courage then! What cannot be avoided	
O brave young Prince! thy famous grandfather	
SOMERSET. But he's deceiv'd; we are in readiness.	
Ye see, I drink the water of my eye.	
Is prisoner to the foe; his state usurp'd,	
SCENE V. Another part of the field	
Exeunt OXFORD and SOMERSET, guarded	
To meet with joy in sweet Jerusalem.	
QUEEN MARGARET. Ah, that thy father had been so resolv'd!	
GLOUCESTER. That you might still have worn the petticoat	
His currish riddle sorts not with this place.	
CLARENCE. Untutor'd lad, thou art too malapert.	
GLOUCESTER. Why should she live to fill the world with words?	
Hard-favour'd Richard? Richard, where art thou?	
Exit, led out forcibly	
	
Exit LIEUTENANT	
Than can my ears that tragic history.	
Thou hadst not liv'd to kill a son of mine.	
Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear,	
Men for their sons, wives for their husbands,	
Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born.	
And if the rest be true which I have heard,	
Down, down to hell; and say I sent thee thither-	
Let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it.	
I'll throw thy body in another room,	
HASTINGS, NURSE, with the Young PRINCE, and attendants	
What valiant foemen, like to autumn's corn,	
Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat	
Went all afoot in summer's scalding heat,	
And heave it shall some weight or break my back.	
CLARENCE. The duty that I owe unto your Majesty	
I seal upon the lips of this sweet babe.	
Sound drums and trumpets. Farewell, sour annoy!

In that behalf which we have challeng'd it;	
And stalk in blood to our possession?	
That to their everlasting residence,	
Upon the dancing banners of the French,	
By our best eyes cannot be censured.	
Blood hath bought blood, and blows have answer'd blows;	
	
Rather, lost more. And by this hand I swear,	
Before we will lay down our just-borne arms,	
You equal potents, fiery kindled spirits!	
Your sharpest deeds of malice on this town.	
I'd play incessantly upon these jades,

No bargains break that are not this day made;	
Hear me, O, hear me!	
O Lymoges! O Austria! thou dost shame	
Thou wear a lion's hide! Doff it for shame,	
BASTARD. And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.	
I Pandulph, of fair Milan cardinal,	
KING JOHN. What earthly name to interrogatories	
Without th' assistance of a mortal hand.	
And meritorious shall that hand be call'd,	
There is no tongue hath power to curse him right.	
Let go the hand of that arch-heretic,	
And raise the power of France upon his head,	
AUSTRIA. King Philip, listen to the Cardinal.	
Or the light loss of England for a friend.	
BLANCH. The Lady Constance speaks not from her faith,	
AUSTRIA. Do so, King Philip; hang no more in doubt.	
And even before this truce, but new before,	
And shall these hands, so lately purg'd of blood,	
That is, to be the champion of our Church.	
And being not done, where doing tends to ill,	
And mak'st an oath the surety for thy truth	
Therefore thy later vows against thy first	
Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts	
Clamours of hell, be measures to our pomp?	
Is 'husband' in my mouth! even for that name,	
Forethought by heaven!	
Father, I may not wish the fortune thine;	
Assured loss before the match be play'd.	
France. Plains near Angiers	
	
	
	
KING JOHN. Hubert, keep this boy. Philip, make up:	
Must by the hungry now be fed upon.	
When gold and silver becks me to come on.	
If ever I remember to be holy,	
KING JOHN. Come hither, Hubert. O my gentle Hubert,	
We owe thee much! Within this wall of flesh	
HUBERT. I am much bounden to your Majesty.	
I had a thing to say-but let it go:	
A passion hateful to my purposes;	
Then, in despite of brooded watchful day,	
And, by my troth, I think thou lov'st me well.	
Though that my death were adjunct to my act,	
Enter KING PHILIP, LEWIS, PANDULPH, and attendants	
CONSTANCE. No, I defy all counsel, all redress,	
But that which ends all counsel, true redress-	
O that my tongue were in the thunder's mouth!	
For, being not mad, but sensible of grief,	
But now will canker sorrow eat my bud	
I could give better comfort than you do.	
O Lord! my boy, my Arthur, my fair son!	
On their departure most of all show evil;	
LEWIS. But what shall I gain by young Arthur's fall?	
May then make all the claim that Arthur did.	
LEWIS. And lose it, life and all, as Arthur did.	
LEWIS. May be he will not touch young Arthur's life,	
PANDULPH. O, Sir, when he shall hear of your approach,	
Out of the bloody fingers' ends of john.	
What may be wrought out of their discontent,	
Now that their souls are topful of offence.	
ACT IV. SCENE 1.	
Enter HUBERT and EXECUTIONERS	
ARTHUR. Good morrow, Hubert.	
Read here, young Arthur.                        [Showing a paper]	
I must be brief, lest resolution drop	
And with my hand at midnight held your head;	
HUBERT.  [Stamps]  Come forth.	
	
I will not struggle, I will stand stone-still.	
Nay, hear me, Hubert! Drive these men away,	
Nor look upon the iron angrily;	
Exeunt EXECUTIONERS	
ARTHUR. O heaven, that there were but a mote in yours,	
So I may keep mine eyes. O, spare mine eyes,	
And would not harm me.	
ARTHUR. No, in good sooth; the fire is dead with grief,	
The breath of heaven hath blown his spirit out,	
HUBERT. But with my breath I can revive it, boy.	
ARTHUR. O, now you look like Hubert! All this while	
SCENE 2.	
Was once superfluous: you were crown'd before,	
Fresh expectation troubled not the land	
And like a shifted wind unto a sail	
We breath'd our counsel; but it pleas'd your Highness	
And well shall you perceive how willingly	
I will both hear and grant you your requests.	
	
What we so fear'd he had a charge to do.	
Before the child himself felt he was sick.	
This must be answer'd either here or hence.	
KING JOHN. Why do you bend such solemn brows on me?	
Think you I bear the shears of destiny?	
That greatness should so grossly offer it.	
There is no sure foundation set on blood,	
	
The copy of your speed is learn'd by them,	
Is stopp'd with dust: the first of April died	
Three days before; but this from rumour's tongue	
	
Then let the worst, unheard, fall on your head.	
To whom he sung, in rude harsh-sounding rhymes,	
Exit HUBERT with PETER	
I have a way to will their loves again;	
BASTARD. The spirit of the time shall teach me speed.	
	
By slaves that take their humours for a warrant	
Witness against us to damnation!	
As bid me tell my tale in express words,	
But thou didst understand me by my signs,	
Throw this report on their incensed rage	
Upon thy feature; for my rage was blind,	
Presented thee more hideous than thou art.	
If I get down and do not break my limbs,	
O me! my uncle's spirit is in these stones.	
SALISBURY. The Count Melun, a noble lord of France,	
BASTARD. But there is little reason in your grief;	
PEMBROKE. Sir, sir, impatience hath his privilege.	
Of murder's arms; this is the bloodiest shame,	
And prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest,	
The incense of a vow, a holy vow,	
SALISBURY. Not till I sheathe it in a murderer's skin.	
Or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame,	
I'll strike thee dead. Put up thy sword betime;	
BIGOT. Who kill'd this prince?	
For villainy is not without such rheum;	
Th' uncleanly savours of a slaughter-house;	
BASTARD. Go, bear him in thine arms.	
And snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace;	
Upon your stubborn usage of the Pope;	
My crown I should give off? Even so I have.	
Away, and glister like the god of war	
To meet displeasure farther from the doors	
Shall we, upon the footing of our land,	
To arms invasive? Shall a beardless boy,	
Mocking the air with colours idly spread,	
They saw we had a purpose of defence.	
And keep it safe for our remembrance;	
I am not glad that such a sore of time	
By making many. O, it grieves my soul	
That I must draw this metal from my side	
Where honourable rescue and defence	
That, for the health and physic of our right,	
To grace the gentry of a land remote	
And great affections wrestling in thy bosom	
Startles mine eyes and makes me more amaz'd	
Figur'd quite o'er with burning meteors.	
Lift up thy brow, renowned Salisbury,	
Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,	
	
PANDULPH. Hail, noble prince of France!	
Am I Rome's slave? What penny hath Rome borne,	
Have I not here the best cards for the game	
	
That hand which had the strength, even at your door.	
To dive like buckets in concealed wells,	
To lie like pawns lock'd up in chests and trunks,	
Of your dear mother England, blush for shame;	
LEWIS. Strike up our drums to find this danger out.	
	
Desires your Majesty to leave the field	
And will not let me welcome this good news.	
For if the French be lords of this loud day,	
What in the world should make me now deceive,	
Since I must lose the use of all deceit?	
	
SCENE 5.	
	
After such bloody toil, we bid good night;	
BASTARD. Come, come; sans compliment, what news abroad?	
BASTARD. Brief, then; and what's the news?	
HUBERT. The King, I fear, is poison'd by a monk;	
I'll tell thee, Hubert, half my power this night,	
SCENE 7.	
	
Foretell the ending of mortality.	
PEMBROKE. His Highness yet doth speak, and holds belief	
PRINCE HENRY. Let him be brought into the orchard here.	
And from the organ-pipe of frailty sings	
And none of you will bid the winter come	
Within me is a hell; and there the poison	
Is as a fiend confin'd to tyrannize	
BASTARD. The Dauphin is preparing hitherward,	
Where God He knows how we shall answer him;	
As we with honour and respect may take,	
If you think meet, this afternoon will post	
	
Scene III. The same. A street.	
Scene III. Within the tent of Brutus.

What mean’st thou by that? Mend me, thou saucy fellow!	
handiwork.	
Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?	
COBBLER.	
	
What tributaries follow him to Rome,	
You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!	
And do you now put on your best attire?	
That needs must light on this ingratitude.	
Assemble all the poor men of your sort,	
Go you down that way towards the Capitol;	
This way will I. Disrobe the images,	
So do you too, where you perceive them thick.	
Calphurnia.	
[_Music ceases._]	
Forget not in your speed, Antonius,	
CAESAR.	
	
[_Sennet. Exeunt all but Brutus and Cassius._]	
	
	
	
Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?	
That you have no such mirrors as will turn	
BRUTUS.	
For that which is not in me?	
CASSIUS.	
Were I a common laugher, or did use	
That I do fawn on men, and hug them hard,	
And after scandal them; or if you know	
	
CASSIUS.	
Well, honour is the subject of my story.	
We both have fed as well, and we can both

He had a fever when he was in Spain,	
His coward lips did from their colour fly,	
Ay, and that tongue of his, that bade the Romans	
A man of such a feeble temper should	
	
Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!	
When went there by an age since the great flood,	
There was a Brutus once that would have brook’d	
Both meet to hear and answer such high things.	
Than to repute himself a son of Rome	
	
Why, for that too.	
Ay, marry, was’t, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler than

CASCA.	
CASCA.	
	
CASCA.	
	
What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!	
	
As if they came from several citizens,	
And after this, let Caesar seat him sure,	
Thunder and lightning. Enter, from opposite sides, Casca with his	
CASCA.	
For I believe, they are portentous things	
CICERO.	
CASCA.	
[_Exit Cicero._]	
CASSIUS.	
	
	
Indeed, they say the senators tomorrow	
If I know this, know all the world besides,	
[_Thunder still._]	
	
CASCA.	
That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand:	
Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.	
	
	
Upon old Brutus’ statue: all this done,	
That done, repair to Pompey’s theatre.	
CASCA.	
His countenance, like richest alchemy,	
For it is after midnight; and ere day,	
When, Lucius, when? Awake, I say! What, Lucius!	
BRUTUS.	
When it is lighted, come and call me here.	
LUCIUS.	
	
	
	
	
[_Exit Lucius._]	
Hide it in smiles and affability:	
Enter Cassius, Casca, Decius, Cinna, Metellus Cimber and Trebonius.	
Good morrow, Brutus; do we trouble you?	
CASSIUS.	
CASSIUS.	
They are all welcome.	
Which is a great way growing on the South,	
Some two months hence, up higher toward the North	
BRUTUS.	
To kindle cowards, and to steel with valour	
That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear	
That other men begin.	
CASSIUS.	
Decius, well urg’d. I think it is not meet,	
To cut the head off, and then hack the limbs,	
BRUTUS.	
Never fear that: if he be so resolved,	
CASSIUS.	
BRUTUS.	
	
BRUTUS.	
Portia, what mean you? Wherefore rise you now?	
I ought to know of: and, upon my knees,	
Some six or seven, who did hide their faces	
As dear to me as are the ruddy drops	
	
O ye gods,	
[_Exit Portia._]	
Enter Lucius with Ligarius.	
BRUTUS.	
A piece of work that will make sick men whole.	
I shall unfold to thee, as we are going,	
	
[_Thunder._]	
I will, my lord.	
Ne’er look’d but on my back; when they shall see	
Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies,	
The noise of battle hurtled in the air,	
And I do fear them!	
When beggars die, there are no comets seen;	
	
	
Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,	
Caesar should be a beast without a heart	
Do not go forth today: call it my fear	
Mark Antony shall say I am not well,	
I come to fetch you to the Senate-house.	
To be afeard to tell grey-beards the truth?	
Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.	
CAESAR.	
She dreamt tonight she saw my statue,	
Came smiling, and did bathe their hands in it.	
	
And this way have you well expounded it.	
Apt to be render’d, for someone to say,	
“Lo, Caesar is afraid”?	
I am ashamed I did yield to them.	
	
Enter Antony.	
	
	
I have an hour’s talk in store for you:	
BRUTUS.	
The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon.	
Enter Artemidorus, reading a paper.

Why dost thou stay?	
I have a man’s mind, but a woman’s might.	
And so return to you, and nothing else?	
Yes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well,	
What Caesar doth, what suitors press to him.	
I heard a bustling rumour, like a fray,	
At mine own house, good lady.	
PORTIA.	
To see him pass on to the Capitol.	
	
The throng that follows Caesar at the heels,	
Of Senators, of Praetors, common suitors,	
Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.	
	
PORTIA.

Hail, Caesar! Read this schedule.

CASSIUS.	
Look how he makes to Caesar: mark him.	
For look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change.

METELLUS.	
[_Kneeling._]	
I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.	
What, Brutus?	
The skies are painted with unnumber’d sparks,	
They are all fire, and every one doth shine;	
That unassailable holds on his rank,	
O Caesar,—	
Hence! wilt thou lift up Olympus?	
CAESAR.	
CASCA.	
	
CASCA.	
CINNA.	
Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.	
	
There is no harm intended to your person,	
Do so; and let no man abide this deed	
	
Fates, we will know your pleasures.	
Grant that, and then is death a benefit:	
Stoop then, and wash. How many ages hence	
That now on Pompey’s basis lies along,	
Brutus shall lead; and we will grace his heels	
SERVANT.	
Say I love Brutus and I honour him;	
Tell him, so please him come unto this place,	
	
I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,	
As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,	
And pity to the general wrong of Rome—	
As fire drives out fire, so pity pity—	
To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony;	
Our arms in strength of malice, and our hearts	
With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.	
And this indeed, O world, the heart of thee.	
But what compact mean you to have with us?	
Sway’d from the point, by looking down on Caesar.	
Why, and wherein, Caesar was dangerous.	
Our reasons are so full of good regard	
Produce his body to the market-place;	
You shall, Mark Antony.	
[_Aside to Cassius._] By your pardon:	
	
About his funeral. And you shall speak	
	
Which, like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips	
	
Passion, I see, is catching; for mine eyes,

Post back with speed, and tell him what hath chanc’d.	
The cruel issue of these bloody men;	
Those that will hear me speak, let ’em stay here;

rose against Caesar, this is my answer: Not that I loved Caesar less,	
was valiant, I honour him; but, as he was ambitious, I slew him. There	
not be a Roman? If any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so	
	
	
Enter Antony and others, with Caesar’s body.	
Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony, who, though he had no hand	
myself, when it shall please my country to need my death.	
FIRST CITIZEN.	
Do grace to Caesar’s corpse, and grace his speech	
Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.	
Let him go up into the public chair.	
	
ANTONY.	
	
	
THIRD CITIZEN.	
	
	
Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral.	
And Brutus is an honourable man.	
He hath brought many captives home to Rome,	
But here I am to speak what I do know.	
	
If thou consider rightly of the matter,	
	
	
For if you should, O, what would come of it?	
You shall read us the will, Caesar’s will!	
Whose daggers have stabb’d Caesar; I do fear it.	
	
They were villains, murderers. The will! Read the will!	
	
You will compel me then to read the will?	
SECOND CITIZEN.	
A ring! Stand round.	
FIRST CITIZEN.	
	
CITIZENS.	
The first time ever Caesar put it on;	
If Brutus so unkindly knock’d, or no;	
	
	
FIRST CITIZEN.	
CITIZENS.	
Stay, countrymen.	
FIRST CITIZEN.	
Would ruffle up your spirits, and put a tongue	
We’ll mutiny.	
CITIZENS.	
SECOND CITIZEN.	
Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,	
Take thou what course thou wilt!	
	
	
Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome.	
He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry,	
	
THIRD CITIZEN.	
Where do you dwell?	
SECOND CITIZEN.	
Ay, and briefly.	
	
Truly, my name is Cinna.	
I am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet.	
It is no matter, his name’s Cinna; pluck but his name out of his heart,	
	
OCTAVIUS.	
OCTAVIUS.	
	
And took his voice who should be prick’d to die	
And having brought our treasure where we will,	
Millions of mischiefs.	
	
	
	
How he received you, let me be resolv’d.	
When love begins to sicken and decay	
	
Sink in the trial. Comes his army on?	
Enter Cassius and Soldiers.	
And if not so, how should I wrong a brother?	
CASSIUS.	
BRUTUS.	
[_Exeunt._]	
For taking bribes here of the Sardians;	
You wrong’d yourself to write in such a case.	
The name of Cassius honours this corruption,	
Remember March, the Ides of March remember:	
I say you are not.	
Have mind upon your health, tempt me no farther.	
	
BRUTUS.	
I durst not?	
CASSIUS.	
	
BRUTUS.	
Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;	
Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,	
	
	
	
For shame, you generals! What do you mean?	
BRUTUS.	
What should the wars do with these jigging fools?	
BRUTUS.	
	
BRUTUS.	
Lucius, a bowl of wine.	
CASSIUS.	
Speak no more of her. Give me a bowl of wine.	
CASSIUS.	
Enter Titinius and Messala.	
	
Cicero one!	
	
BRUTUS.	
	
MESSALA.	
	
The enemy, marching along by them,	
Hear me, good brother.	
There is a tide in the affairs of men,	
We’ll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi.	
There is no more to say?	
	
This was an ill beginning of the night.	
BRUTUS.	
VARRO.	
	
I was sure your lordship did not give it me.	
	
It is my duty, sir.	
LUCIUS.	
	
If thou dost nod, thou break’st thy instrument;	
BRUTUS.	
To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.	
	
	
	
Yes, that thou didst. Didst thou see anything?	
BRUTUS.	
My lord?	
	
	
BRUTUS.	
BRUTUS.	
Bid him set on his powers betimes before,

Stand fast, Titinius; we must out and talk.	
	
	
ANTONY.	
In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words;	
Unless thou bring’st them with thee.	
OCTAVIUS.	
ANTONY.	
	
You know that I held Epicurus strong,	
This morning are they fled away and gone,	
For I am fresh of spirit, and resolv’d	
	
Even so, Lucilius.	
If we do lose this battle, then is this	
Even by the rule of that philosophy	
For fear of what might fall, so to prevent	
You are contented to be led in triumph	
That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;	
Must end that work the Ides of March begun;	
For ever and for ever farewell, Brutus.	
	
Alarum. Enter Brutus and Messala.	
	
This ensign here of mine was turning back;	
TITINIUS.	
O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early,	
Who, having some advantage on Octavius,	
And here again, that I may rest assur’d

CASSIUS.	
This day I breathed first. Time is come round,	
	
	
	
That ran through Caesar’s bowels, search this bosom.	
As Cassius’ legions are by Antony.	
TITINIUS.	
Is not that he that lies upon the ground?	
MESSALA.	
No, this was he, Messala,	
But kill’st the mother that engender’d thee!	
What, Pindarus! where art thou, Pindarus?	
MESSALA.	
[_Exit Messala._]	
	
I will proclaim my name about the field.	
O young and noble Cato, art thou down?	
Safe, Antony; Brutus is safe enough.	
Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus.	
[_Exeunt._]	
	
	
	
CLITUS.	
BRUTUS.	
O Dardanius!	
DARDANIUS.

CLITUS.	
Thou art a fellow of a good respect;	
Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord.	
Farewell, good Strato.—Caesar, now be still:	
I kill’d not thee with half so good a will.	
What man is that?

In the converse of breath- your gentleness	
And though the mourning brow of progeny	
From what it purpos'd; since to wail friends lost	
And by these badges understand the King.	
For your fair sakes have we neglected time,	
To every varied object in his glance;	
Have misbecom'd our oaths and gravities,	
And even that falsehood, in itself a sin,	
Your favours, the ambassadors of love;	
At courtship, pleasant jest, and courtesy,	
Have we not been; and therefore met your loves

If frosts and fasts, hard lodging and thin weeds,	
With threefold love I wish you all these three.

Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,	
	
What hath quench'd them hath given me fire. Hark! Peace!	
	
Listening their fear, I could not say "Amen,"	
MACBETH. I heard a voice cry, "Sleep no more!	
Macbeth does murther sleep" -the innocent sleep,	
Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,	
MACBETH. I'll go no more.	
I am afraid to think what I have done;

And little is to do.

If that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayer	
Finding yourself desir'd of such a person	
Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,	
Should die for ever.

And from this testimony of your own sex,	
Which seems a little fouler than it is,

Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;	
Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:	
I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,	
That none but fools would keep. A breath thou art,	
Are nurs'd by baseness. Thou 'rt by no means valiant;	
Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;	
Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,

To cleave a heart in twain.

And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.

The Duke's in council, and your noble self,	
I am sure, is sent for.	
For if such actions may have passage free,	
Officers attending.	
We must not think the Turk is so unskillful	
To wake and wage a danger profitless.

Your trusty and most valiant servitor,

FIRST SENATOR. Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.	
	
That it engluts and swallows other sorrows,	
And it is still itself.	
BRABANTIO.                                    Ay, to me.	
She is abused, stol'n from me and corrupted	
BRABANTIO.              Humbly I thank your Grace.	
Here is the man, this Moor, whom now, it seems,	
Hath hither brought.	
BRABANTIO.            A maiden never bold,	
I do confess the vices of my blood,	
And portance in my travels' history;	
Would Desdemona seriously incline;	
She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear	
Whereof by parcels she had something heard,	
'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful.	
And I loved her that she did pity them.	
If she confess that she was half the wooer,	
I had rather to adopt a child than get it.	
For thy escape would teach me tyranny,	
Which, as a grise or step, may help these lovers	
With such accommodation and besort	
DUKE. What would you, Desdemona?	
May trumpet to the world. My heart's subdued	
And to his honors and his valiant parts	
With such things else of quality and respect	
A man he is of honesty and trust.	
To his conveyance I assign my wife,	
Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.

will. Come, be a man! Drown thyself? Drown cats and blind	
answerable sequestration- put but money in thy purse. These Moors	
a pleasure, me a sport. There are many events in the womb of time	
	
MONTANO. Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land;	
For do but stand upon the foaming shore,	
That their designment halts. A noble ship of Venice	
Is come on shore; the Moor himself at sea,	
And is in full commission here for Cyprus.	
THIRD GENTLEMAN. But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort

The divine Desdemona.	
And chides with thinking.	
Players in your housewifery, and housewives in your beds.	
DESDEMONA. O, fie upon thee, slanderer!	
IAGO. Ay, madam.	
EMILIA. How if fair and foolish?	
To change the cod's head for the salmon's tail;	
IAGO. To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.	
The Moor! I know his trumpet.	
If after every tempest come such calms,	
Olympus-high, and duck again as low

CASSIO. For mine own part- no offense to the general, nor any man

drunk now; I can stand well enough, and I speak well enough.	
IAGO. You see this fellow that is gone before;	
	
I pray you, after the lieutenant; go.              Exit Roderigo.	
To cure him of this evil- But, hark! What noise?	
Nay, good lieutenant! God's will, gentlemen!	
The town will rise. God's will, lieutenant, hold!	
Have you forgot all place of sense and duty?

In mouths of wisest censure. What's the matter,	
Your officer, Iago, can inform you-	
'Tis monstrous. Iago, who began't?	
Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general.	
There comes a fellow crying out for help,	
For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,	
From him that fled some strange indignity,	
Which patience could not pass.	
Come, Desdemona, 'tis the soldiers' life.

for thee. If the gentlewoman that attends the general's wife be

Enter Iago.	
	
Out of the way, that your converse and business	
	
To speak your bosom freely.	
	
DESDEMONA. O, that's an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio,	
Than give thy cause away.	
OTHELLO. What dost thou say?	
For if he be not one that truly loves you,	
I have no judgement in an honest face.	
That he hath left part of his grief with me	
On Tuesday noon, or night, on Wednesday morn.	
Exceed three days. In faith, he's penitent;	
To incur a private check. When shall he come?	
Hath ta'en your part- to have so much to do	
To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much-	
DESDEMONA.                  Why, this is not a boon;	
Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit	
Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,	
OTHELLO.                     I will deny thee nothing,	
Is he not honest?	
And didst contract and purse thy brow together,	
IAGO.                       For Michael Cassio,	
Keep leets and law-days, and in session sit	
A stranger to thy thoughts.	
The meat it feeds on. That cuckold lives in bliss	
OTHELLO. Dost thou say so?	
IAGO.                                  Why, go to then.	
I hope you will consider what is spoke	
I am to pray you not to strain my speech	
To grosser issues nor to larger reach	
IAGO. Ay, there's the point, as- to be bold with you-	
OTHELLO. Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless	
With any strong or vehement importunity;	
Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,	
Into the vale of years- yet that's not much-	
Than keep a corner in the thing I love	
Prerogatived are they less than the base;	
	
If she be false, O, then heaven mocks itself!	
Are you not well?	
He puts the handkerchief from him, and she drops it.	
My wayward husband hath a hundred times	
To kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out,	
Heaven knows, not I;	
IAGO. To have a foolish wife.	
EMILIA. O, is that all? What will you give me now	
To have me filch it?	
OTHELLO.                       Ha, ha, false to me?	
OTHELLO. Avaunt! be gone! Thou hast set me on the rack.	
Let him not know't and he's not robb'd at all.	
Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war!	
Than answer my waked wrath!	
That livest to make thine honesty a vice!	
O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world,	
I think my wife be honest, and think she is not;	
I'll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!	
Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,	
As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross	
IAGO. I do not like the office;	
'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.	
Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief	
Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne	
Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,	
Witness, you ever-burning lights above,	
What bloody business ever.                             They rise.	
Within these three days let me hear thee say	
CLOWN. I will catechize the world for him; that is, make questions	
DESDEMONA. Seek him, bid him come hither. Tell him I have moved my	
lord on his behalf and hope all will be well.	
EMILIA. I know not, madam.	
As jealous creatures are, it were enough	
Drew all such humors from him.	
Be call'd to him.	
How do you, Desdemona?	
For here's a young and sweating devil here	
A frank one.	
But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.	
Make it a darling like your precious eye;	
DESDEMONA.                     Is't possible?	
The sun to course two hundred compasses,	
DESDEMONA. Heaven bless us!	
This is a trick to put me from my suit.	
OTHELLO. Away!                                                Exit.	
DESDEMONA. I ne'er saw this before.	
IAGO. There is no other way; 'tis she must do't.	
Entirely honor. I would not be delay'd.	
When it hath blown his ranks into the air	
There's matter in't indeed if he be angry.	
Something sure of state,	
Our other healthful members even to that sense	
Of pain. Nay, we must think men are not gods,	
And no conception nor no jealous toy	
If I do find him fit, I'll move your suit,	
O weary reckoning!	
But I shall in a more continuate time	
BIANCA.                  O Cassio, whence came this?	
Take it, and do't; and leave me for this time.	
CASSIO. I do attend here on the general;	
BIANCA.                          But that you do not love me.	
IAGO. Will you think so?	
An hour or more, not meaning any harm?	
Or heard him say- as knaves be such abroad,	
Who having, by their own importunate suit,	
OTHELLO. Lie with her! lie on her! We say lie on her, when they	
And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,	
I would on great occasion speak with you.            Exit Cassio.	
How is it, general? Have you not hurt your head?	
O, 'tis the spite of hell, the fiend's arch-mock,	
Confine yourself but in a patient list.	
For I will make him tell the tale anew,	
I will be found most cunning in my patience;	
Othello retires.	
Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,	
To beguile many and be beguiled by one.	
From the excess of laughter. Here he comes.	
Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?	
OTHELLO. Look, how he laughs already!	
OTHELLO. Do you triumph, Roman? Do you triumph?	
thither comes the bauble, and, by this hand, she falls me thus	
me. Ha, ha, ha!	
OTHELLO. Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O, I see	
that nose of yours, but not that dog I shall throw it to.	
CASSIO. Faith, I must; she'll rail i' the street else.	
IAGO. Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?	
She might lie by an emperor's side, and command him tasks.	
OTHELLO. Hang her! I do but say what she is. So delicate with her	
IAGO. And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker. You shall hear more	
Come from the Duke. And, see your wife is with him.	
LODOVICO. I thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio?	
DESDEMONA. I have not deserved this.	
Make her amends; she weeps.	
If that the earth could teem with woman's tears,	
Exit Desdemona.	
Cassio shall have my place. And, sir, tonight,	
LODOVICO.                    What, strike his wife!	
LODOVICO.                            Is it his use?	
That I may save my speech. Do but go after,	
EMILIA. But then I saw no harm, and then I heard	
She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd	
And yet she'll kneel and pray; I have seen her do't.	
Enter Desdemona with Emilia.	
DESDEMONA.         What horrible fancy's this?	
OTHELLO. O Desdemona! Away! away! away!	
If haply you my father do suspect	
To try me with affliction, had they rain'd	
Patience, thou young and rose-lipp'd cherubin,	
That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst ne'er been born!	
Did I but speak thy deeds. What committed!	
And will not hear it. What committed?	
OTHELLO.                         I cry you mercy then;	
	
We have done our course; there's money for your pains.	
EMILIA. Alas, what does this gentleman conceive?

CASSIO. O, help!	
IAGO. Who's there? Whose noise is this that cries on murther?	
IAGO.                                       What's the matter?	
GRATIANO. This is Othello's ancient, as I take it.	
Who they should be that have thus mangled you?	
To be a party in this injury.	
Patience awhile, good Cassio. Come, come;	
Alas, my friend and my dear countryman	
IAGO. Even he, sir. Did you know him?	
IAGO. Signior Gratiano? I cry you gentle pardon;	
Some good man bear him carefully from hence;	
Cassio and Roderigo are borne off.	
Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.	
Enter Emilia.	
	
IAGO. Cassio hath here been set on in the dark	
Will you go on? [Aside.] This is the night	
	
Enter Othello.	
It is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood,	
Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow	
Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men.	
Should I repent me; but once put out thy light,	
OTHELLO. Have you pray'd tonight, Desdemona?	
OTHELLO. Ay, I do.	
DESDEMONA. If you say so, I hope you will not kill me.	
DESDEMONA. Ay, but not yet to die.	
Let him confess a truth.	
OTHELLO. That he hath used thee.	
OTHELLO. Ay.	
OTHELLO. Nay, if you strive-	
EMILIA. [Within.] What, ho! my lord, my lord!	
'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death.	
EMILIA.                                   Alas, what cry is that?	
OTHELLO. She's like a liar gone to burning hell;	
OTHELLO. Ay, with Cassio. Nay, had she been true,	
An honest man he is, and hates the slime	
EMILIA. Do thy worst;	
Than thou wast worthy her.

Lord Cerimon hath letters of good credit, sir,	
My father’s dead.	
Will in that kingdom spend our following days:	
Although assail’d with Fortune fierce and keen,	
Virtue preserved from fell destruction’s blast,	
LORD FITZWATER                        BISHOP OF CARLISLE	
LADY attending on the Queen	
Aim'd at your Highness-no inveterate malice.	
MOWBRAY. Each day still better other's happiness	
As well appeareth by the cause you come;	
The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,	
Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,	
MOWBRAY. I take it up; and by that sword I swear	
Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood	
Disburs'd I duly to his Highness' soldiers;	
The other part reserv'd I by consent,	
Neglected my sworn duty in that case.	
Once did I lay an ambush for your life,	
Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk's gage.	
The one my duty owes; but my fair name,	
KING RICHARD. Rage must be withstood:	
And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,	
Mine honour is my life; both grow in one;	
Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong	
Where shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray's face.	
Which since we cannot do to make you friends,	
Justice design the victor's chivalry.	
Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?	
Some of those seven are dried by nature's course,	
Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee.	
DUCHESS. Why then, I will. Farewell, old Gaunt.	
Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight.	
Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York.	
Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?	
a HERALD	
Speak truly on thy knighthood and thy oath;	
And, by the grace of God and this mine arm,	
A traitor to my God, my King, and me.	
The trumpets sound. Enter BOLINGBROKE, Duke of Hereford,	
	
Thus plated in habiliments of war;	
Or daring-hardy as to touch the lists,	
Except the Marshal and such officers	
BOLINGBROKE. Lord Marshal, let me kiss my sovereign's hand,	
And loving farewell of our several friends.	
MARSHAL. The appellant in all duty greets your Highness,	
Cousin of Hereford, as thy cause is right,	
Not sick, although I have to do with death,	
Whose youthful spirit, in me regenerate,	
And furbish new the name of John o' Gaunt,	
Even in the lusty haviour of his son.	
Cast off his chains of bondage, and embrace	
BOLINGBROKE. Strong as a tower in hope, I cry amen.	
FIRST HERALD. Harry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby,	
A traitor to his God, his King, and him;	
On pain to be found false and recreant,	
Stay, the King hath thrown his warder down.	
For that our kingdom's earth should not be soil'd	
Of sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts,	
And those his golden beams to you here lent	
The hopeless word of 'never to return'	
A dearer merit, not so deep a maim	
That knows no touch to tune the harmony.	
Is made my gaoler to attend on me.	
After our sentence plaining comes too late.	
To dwell in solemn shades of endless night.	
KING RICHARD. Return again, and take an oath with thee.	
Our part therein we banish with yourselves,	
Nor never write, regreet, nor reconcile	
BOLINGBROKE. I swear.	
GAUNT. I thank my liege that in regard of me	
Whereto thy tongue a party-verdict gave.	
Why at our justice seem'st thou then to lour?	
I was too strict to make mine own away;	
KING RICHARD. Cousin, farewell; and, uncle, bid him so.	
Flourish. Exit KING with train	
I wander from the jewels that I love.	
Must I not serve a long apprenticehood	
Having my freedom, boast of nothing else	
Teach thy necessity to reason thus:	
But thou the King. Woe doth the heavier sit	
BOLINGBROKE. O, who can hold a fire in his hand	
Than when he bites, but lanceth not the sore.	
My mother, and my nurse, that bears me yet!	
Should so profane the word, that taught me craft	
Marry, would the word 'farewell' have length'ned hours	
	
Consuming means, soon preys upon itself.	
This other Eden, demi-paradise,	
This precious stone set in the silver sea,	
This land of such dear souls, this dear dear land,	
Like to a tenement or pelting farm.	
Of wat'ry Neptune, is now bound in with shame,	
GAUNT. O, how that name befits my composition!	
The pleasure that some fathers feed upon	
KING RICHARD. Can sick men play so nicely with their names?	
KING RICHARD. Should dying men flatter with those that live?	
GAUNT. No, no; men living flatter those that die.	
Thy death-bed is no lesser than thy land	
O, had thy grandsire with a prophet's eye	
From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame,	
Which art possess'd now to depose thyself.	
Thy state of law is bondslave to the law;	
Hast thou tapp'd out, and drunkenly carous'd.	
May be a precedent and witness good	
Live in thy shame, but die not shame with thee!	
YORK. I do beseech your Majesty impute his words	
	
NORTHUMBERLAND. Nay, nothing; all is said.	
Whereof our uncle Gaunt did stand possess'd.	
Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong?	
His hands were guilty of no kindred blood,	
Did not the one deserve to have an heir?	
And prick my tender patience to those thoughts	
But by bad courses may be understood	
For he is just, and always lov'd us well.	
Come on, our queen; to-morrow must we part;	
Merely in hate, 'gainst any of us an,	
As blanks, benevolences, and I wot not what;	
ROSS. He hath not money for these Irish wars,	
ROSS. Be confident to speak, Northumberland.	
His brother, Archbishop late of Canterbury,	
Exeunt	
	
	
Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune's womb,	
I cannot but be sad; so heavy sad	
Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.	
BUSHY. 'Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.	
I hope the King is not yet shipp'd for Ireland.	
Who strongly hath set footing in this land.	
The Lord Northumberland, his son young Henry Percy,	
QUEEN. Who shall hinder me?	
QUEEN. With signs of war about his aged neck.	
O, full of careful business are his looks!	
Whilst others come to make him lose at home.	
	
SERVINGMAN. My lord, your son was gone before I came.	
Hold, take my ring.	
So my untruth had not provok'd him to it,	
Never believe me. Both are my kinsmen.	
BUSHY. That's as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke.	
And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar,	
But theirs is sweet'ned with the hope to have	
And hope to joy is little less in joy	
Shall make their way seem short, as mine hath done	
NORTHUMBERLAND. Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy?	
PERCY. No, my good lord; for that is not forgot	
Which ne'er I did remember; to my knowledge,	
It shall be still thy true love's recompense.	
My heart this covenant makes, my hand thus seals it.	
WILLOUGHBY. And far surmounts our labour to attain it.	
BERKELEY. Mistake me not, my lord; 'tis not my meaning	
	
Enter YORK, attended	
[Kneels]	
Dar'd once to touch a dust of England's ground?	
But then more 'why?'-why have they dar'd to march	
Why, foolish boy, the King is left behind,	
Were I but now lord of such hot youth	
Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye.	
You are my father, for methinks in you	
Had you first died, and he been thus trod down,	
But in this kind to come, in braving arms,	
Be his own carver and cut out his way,	
And let him never see joy that breaks that oath!	
YORK. Well, well, I see the issue of these arms.	
But since I cannot, be it known unto you	
And there repose you for this night.	
The caterpillars of the commonwealth,	
	
And hardly kept our countrymen together,	
And yet we hear no tidings from the King;	
Rich men look sad, and ruffians dance and leap-	
The other to enjoy by rage and war.	
ACT III. SCENE I. BOLINGBROKE'S camp at Bristol	
Eating the bitter bread of banishment,	
To show the world I am a gentleman.	
With letters of your love to her at large.	
As a long-parted mother with her child	
But let thy spiders, that suck up thy venom,	
But when from under this terrestrial ball	
Did triumph in my face, and they are fled;	
At thy great glory. Look not to the ground,	
	
	
SCROOP. More health and happiness betide my liege	
And what loss is it to be rid of care?	
Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we?	
With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel.	
Would they make peace? Terrible hell make war	
SCROOP. Sweet love, I see, changing his property,	
That rounds the mortal temples of a king	
Keeps Death his court; and there the antic sits,	
Tradition, form, and ceremonious duty;	
To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength,	
Say, Scroop, where lies our uncle with his power?	
To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken:	
KING RICHARD. Thou hast said enough.	
KING RICHARD. He does me double wrong	
From Richard's night to Bolingbroke's fair day.       Exeunt	
PERCY. Yes, my good lord,	
It doth contain a king; King Richard lies	
With no less terror than the elements	
Of fire and water, when their thund'ring shock	
To dim his glory and to stain the track	
Controlling majesty. Alack, alack, for woe,	
And threat the glory of my precious crown.	
To scarlet indignation, and bedew	
And by the honourable tomb he swears	
His coming hither hath no further scope	
Enfranchisement immediate on his knees;	
His barbed steeds to stables, and his heart	
This swears he, as he is a prince, is just;	
With words of sooth! O that I were as great	
KING RICHARD. What must the King do now? Must he submit?	
My gay apparel for an almsman's gown,	
My subjects for a pair of carved saints,	
Or I'll be buried in the king's high way,	
And make a dearth in this revolting land.	
Give Richard leave to live till Richard die?	
KING RICHARD. Down, down I come, like glist'ring Phaethon,	
[Touching his own head] Thus high at least, although your	
BOLINGBROKE. My gracious lord, I come but for mine own.	
Uncle, give me your hands; nay, dry your eyes:	
What you will have, I'll give, and willing too;	
SCENE 4. The DUKE OF YORK's garden	
LADY. Madam, we'll tell tales.	
They will talk of state, for every one doth so	
GARDENER. Hold thy peace.	
I mean the Earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Green.	
That he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his land	
Do wound the bark, the skin of our fruit trees,	
Had he done so, himself had home the crown,	
Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down.	
What Eve, what serpent, hath suggested the	
To breathe this news; yet what I say is true.	
	
PERCY, FITZWATER, SURREY, the BISHOP OF CARLISLE, the ABBOT OF	
WESTMINSTER, and others; HERALD, OFFICERS, and BAGOT	
In that dead time when Gloucester's death was plotted	
BOLINGBROKE. Bagot, forbear; thou shalt not take it up.	
If thou deniest it twenty times, thou liest;	
FITZWATER. Surrey, thou liest.	
I dare meet Surrey in a wilderness,	
That thou, Aumerle, didst send two of thy men	
To execute the noble Duke at Calais.	
And his pure soul unto his captain, Christ,	
BOLINGBROKE. Why, Bishop, is Norfolk dead?	
To the possession of thy royal hand.	
CARLISLE. Marry, God forbid!	
Is a foul traitor to proud Hereford's king;	
bearing the regalia	
So Judas did to Christ; but he, in twelve,	
BOLINGBROKE. I thought you had been willing to resign.	
With mine own tears I wash away my balm,	
My manors, rents, revenues, I forgo;	
My acts, decrees, and statutes, I deny.	
And soon lie Richard in an earthly pit.	
NORTHUMBERLAND. My lord-	
That it may show me what a face I have	
BOLINGBROKE. Go some of you and fetch a looking-glass.	
The shadow of my sorrow? Ha! let's see.	
And these external manner of laments	
Are merely shadows to the unseen grief	
And then be gone and trouble you no more.	
Were then but subjects; being now a subject,	
KING RICHARD. Then give me leave to go.	
Exeunt KING RICHARD, some Lords and a Guard	
Our coronation. Lords, prepare yourselves.	
ABBOT. A woeful pageant have we here beheld.	
	
Which our profane hours here have thrown down.	
Transform'd and weak'ned? Hath Bolingbroke depos'd	
More than it is, ere foul sin gathering head	
Take leave, and part; for you must part forthwith.	
My wife to France, from whence set forth in pomp,	
QUEEN. And must we be divided? Must we part?	
QUEEN. So longest way shall have the longest moans.	
One kiss shall stop our mouths, and dumbly part;	
Thus give I mine, and thus take I thy heart.	
Are idly bent on him that enters next,	
And barbarism itself have pitied him.	
And lasting fealty to the new-made king.	
	
What news from Oxford? Do these justs and triumphs hold?	
AUMERLE. My lord, 'tis nothing.	
YORK. No matter, then, who see it.	
[He plucks it out of his bosom, and reads it]	
Is not my teeming date drunk up with time?	
And rob me of a happy mother's name?	
And interchangeably set down their hands	
	
I would to God, my lords, he might be found.	
He would unhorse the lustiest challenger.	
	
So wildly?	
Exeunt PERCY and LORDS	
BOLINGBROKE. [Drawing] Villain, I'll make thee safe.	
Open the door, or I will break it open.	
And he shall spend mine honour with his shame,	
This let alone will all the rest confound.	
[Kneels]	
DUCHESS. Pleads he in earnest? Look upon his face;	
His prayers are full of false hypocrisy;	
Say 'pardon,' King; let pity teach thee how.	
Ah, my sour husband, my hard-hearted lord,	
BOLINGBROKE. Good aunt, stand up.	
But I will have them, if I once know where.	
Uncle, farewell; and, cousin, adieu;	
Was it not so?	
SERVANT. He did.	
My brain I'll prove the female to my soul,	
And these same thoughts people this little world,	
Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot	
May tear a passage through the flinty ribs	
And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.	
And none contented. Sometimes am I king;	
But, for the concord of my state and time,	
For now hath time made me his numb'ring clock:	
GROOM. I was a poor groom of thy stable, King,	
KING RICHARD. Rode he on Barbary? Tell me, gentle friend,	
GROOM. So proudly as if he disdain'd the ground.	
That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand;	
KEEPER. Fellow, give place; here is no longer stay.	
[Beats the KEEPER]	
Villain, thy own hand yields thy death's instrument.	
Take hence the rest, and give them burial here.       Exeunt

To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,

As I am subtle, false, and treacherous,

As all the world is cheered by the sun,

My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;	
And what these sorrows could not thence exhale	
I never sued to friend nor enemy;	
My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.

If I unwittingly, or in my rage,

When great leaves fall, then winter is at hand;

Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.	
Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,	
Then, taking him from thence that is not there,	
HASTINGS. I go, my lord.	
PRINCE. I do not like the Tower, of any place.	
Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?	
PRINCE. An if I live until I be a man,	
BUCKINGHAM. Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of	
GLOUCESTER. O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.	
GLOUCESTER. Ay, gentle cousin, were it light enough.	
Lord?	
BUCKINGHAM. With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!	
So cunning and so young is wonderful.	
My grandam told me he was murder'd there.	
Catesby,	
If thou dost find him tractable to us,	
To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret Castle;	
Give Mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more.

Till Richard wear the garland of the realm.	
But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?	
Well, Catesby, ere a fortnight make me older,

HASTINGS. My lord, I hold my life as dear as yours,	
What, shall we toward the Tower? The day is spent.	
Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest:	
	
Enter SIR RICHARD RATCLIFF, with halberds, carrying the Nobles,	
	
RIVERS. Sir Richard Ratcliff, let me tell thee this:	
And for more slander to thy dismal seat,	
Who is most inward with the noble Duke?	
I have been long a sleeper, but I trust

And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,	
As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house.	
I now repent I told the pursuivant,	
O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse	
Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!	
That ever wretched age hath look'd upon.

We live to tell it-that the subtle traitor

Which now the loving haste of these our friends,	
Misconster us in him and wail his death.	
MAYOR. But, my good lord, your Grace's words shall serve	
Which well appeared in his lineaments,	
Because, my lord, you know my mother lives.	
To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight,	
SCRIVENER. Here is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings;	
That it may be to-day read o'er in Paul's.	
And mark how well the sequel hangs together:	
GLOUCESTER. Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's	
Which when I saw, I reprehended them,	
'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I	
And be not easily won to our requests.	
GLOUCESTER. I go; and if you plead as well for them	
Now, Catesby, what says your lord to my request?	
He is within, with two right reverend fathers,	
Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,	
But meditating with two deep divines;	
Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,	
Happy were England would this virtuous prince	
Exit CATESBY	
Lend favourable ear to our requests,	
Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.	
Who, earnest in the service of my God,	
GLOUCESTER. I do suspect I have done some offence	
To the corruption of a blemish'd stock;	
Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,	
And kingly government of this your land-	
Then, on the other side, I check'd my friends.	
But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,	
All circumstances well considered.	
These both put off, a poor petitioner,	
Save that, for reverence to some alive,	
But we will plant some other in the throne	
Since you will buckle fortune on my back,	
BUCKINGHAM. To-morrow, then, we will attend your Grace;

KING RICHARD. Ha! am I King? 'Tis so; but Edward lives.	
KING RICHARD. Tut, tut, thou art all ice; thy kindness freezes.

Will tempt unto a close exploit of death?	
That Anne, my queen, is sick and like to die.	
I must be married to my brother's daughter,	
Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass.	
Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.

And he that slew them fouler than he is.

From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done!	
DUCHESS. Where is kind Hastings?

KING RICHARD. So.

If thou didst fear to break an oath with Him,

QUEEN ELIZABETH. I go. Write to me very shortly,	
	
KING RICHARD. O, true, good Catesby. Bid him levy straight	
And meet me suddenly at Salisbury.	
Once more, what news?	
He makes for England here to claim the crown.	
Thou wilt revolt and fly to him, I fear.	
When they should serve their sovereign in the west?	
But I'll not trust thee.	
As I by friends am well advertised,

Give me some ink and paper in my tent.	
My Lord of Oxford-you, Sir William Brandon-	
Desire the Earl to see me in my tent.	
Yet one thing more, good Captain, do for me-	
Sweet Blunt, make some good means to speak with him	
And so, God give you quiet rest to-night!	
NORFOLK. I go, my lord.	
NORFOLK. I warrant you, my lord.                          Exit	
KING RICHARD. So, I am satisfied. Give me a bowl of wine.

Arm, fight, and conquer, for fair England's sake!	
And weigh thee down to ruin, shame, and death!	
[To RICHMOND]  Thou quiet soul, sleep thou a quiet sleep;	
But cheer thy heart and be thou not dismay'd:	
Throng to the bar, crying all 'Guilty! guilty!'	
KING RICHARD. O Ratcliff, I have dream'd a fearful dream!	
That you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here.	
That ever ent'red in a drowsy head

One that hath ever been God's enemy.	
He should have brav'd the east an hour ago.

BENVOLIO.	
I aim’d so near when I suppos’d you lov’d.	
Nor bide th’encounter of assailing eyes,	
	
Examine other beauties.	
	
	
Of honourable reckoning are you both,	
My child is yet a stranger in the world,	
Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.	
And too soon marr’d are those so early made.	
One more, most welcome, makes my number more.	
Among fresh female buds shall you this night	
Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see,

Go thither and with unattainted eye,	
Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars.

Your mother.	
We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again,	
Nay, I do bear a brain. But as I said,	
When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple	
A perilous knock, and it cried bitterly.	
‘Yea,’ quoth my husband, ‘fall’st upon thy face?	
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;

With nimble soles, I have a soul of lead	
Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.	
MERCUTIO.

Nay, that’s not so.	
Five times in that ere once in our five wits.	
MERCUTIO.	
Her waggoner, a small grey-coated gnat,

Away, be gone; the sport is at the best.	
Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.	
Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone,	
	
My grave is like to be my wedding bed.	
His name is Romeo, and a Montague,

By love, that first did prompt me to enquire;	
I am no pilot; yet wert thou as far	
I should adventure for such merchandise.	
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say Ay,	
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.

May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.	
What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?

The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.

As Phaeton would whip you to the west	
Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,	
That runaway’s eyes may wink, and Romeo	
That all the world will be in love with night,	
And pay no worship to the garish sun.	
	
JULIET.	
Can heaven be so envious?	
Romeo can,	
	
To prison, eyes; ne’er look on liberty.	
Then dreadful trumpet sound the general doom,	
	
Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished,	
Romeo that kill’d him, he is banished.	
In such a gorgeous palace.	
All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.	
Will you speak well of him that kill’d your cousin?	
Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?	
Your tributary drops belong to woe,	
Like damned guilty deeds to sinners’ minds.	
Thy father or thy mother, nay or both,	
	
NURSE.	
	
	
Hence banished is banish’d from the world,	
’Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here	
	
Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.	
Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,	
An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,	
Doting like me, and like me banished,	
	
Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes.	
O holy Friar, O, tell me, holy Friar,	
O, he is even in my mistress’ case.	
ROMEO.	
Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?	
Shot from the deadly level of a gun,	
Murder’d her kinsman. O, tell me, Friar, tell me,

Go, get thee to thy love as was decreed,

Things have fallen out, sir, so unluckily	
LADY CAPULET.	
	
Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed,	
	
Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat	
I have more care to stay than will to go.	
Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes.

Farewell!	
O thinkest thou we shall ever meet again?	
[_Exit below._]	
JULIET.	
	
JULIET.	
	
What villain, madam?	
	
We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.	
	
To wreak the love I bore my cousin	
Upon his body that hath slaughter’d him.	
One who to put thee from thy heaviness,	
I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear	
I would the fool were married to her grave.	
	
JULIET.	
Speak not, reply not, do not answer me.	
NURSE.	
And why, my lady wisdom? Hold your tongue,	
I speak no treason.	
Peace, you mumbling fool!	
And then to have a wretched puling fool,	
	
Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.	
How shall that faith return again to earth,	
What say’st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?	
Romeo’s a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,	
What?

And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.	
PARIS.	
For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.	
	
PARIS.	
	
Come you to make confession to this father?	
	
Thou wrong’st it more than tears with that report.	
Are you at leisure, holy father, now,	
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.	
Do thou but call my resolution wise,	
Which craves as desperate an execution	
As that is desperate which we would prevent.	
From off the battlements of yonder tower,	
And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.	
	
	
Ay, forsooth.	
Where I have learnt me to repent the sin	
By holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here,	
CAPULET.	
Why, I am glad on’t. This is well. Stand up.	
This is as’t should be. Let me see the County.	
JULIET.	
[_Exeunt Juliet and Nurse._]	
We shall be short in our provision,	
To move the heavens to smile upon my state,	
And let the nurse this night sit up with you,	
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?	
Or, if I live, is it not very like,	
Where for this many hundred years the bones	
Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,	
Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,	
Alack, alack, is it not like that I,	
That living mortals, hearing them, run mad.	
	
	
LADY CAPULET.	
	
Get you to bed; faith, you’ll be sick tomorrow	
But I will watch you from such watching now.

He’ll fright you up, i’faith. Will it not be?

Alack the day, she’s dead, she’s dead, she’s dead!	
Ha! Let me see her. Out alas! She’s cold,	
Her blood is settled and her joints are stiff.

Had part in this fair maid, now heaven hath all,	
Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast;	
Sir, go you in, and, madam, go with him,	
To follow this fair corse unto her grave.	
	
Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up,

Being holiday, the beggar’s shop is shut.

Scene I. A hall in PETRUCHIO’S country house.	
HOSTESS	
Servants to Petruchio	
	
KATHERINA, the shrew	
came in with Richard Conqueror. Therefore, _paucas pallabris_; let the	
Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I’ll answer him by law. I’ll not	
budge an inch, boy: let him come, and kindly.	
Horns winded. Enter a Lord from hunting, with Huntsmen and Servants.	
	
And couple Clowder with the deep-mouth’d brach.	
He cried upon it at the merest loss,	
Thou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet,	
I will, my lord.	
SECOND HUNTSMAN.	
What think you, if he were convey’d to bed,	
	
And hang it round with all my wanton pictures;	
	
’Twas where you woo’d the gentlewoman so well.	
The rather for I have some sport in hand	
But I am doubtful of your modesties,	
And so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,	
If you should smile, he grows impatient.	
PLAYER.	
Let them want nothing that my house affords.	
That done, conduct him to the drunkard’s chamber,	
And call him ‘madam,’ do him obeisance.	
Wherein your lady and your humble wife	
See this dispatch’d with all the haste thou canst;	
apparel, basin, ewer, and other appurtenances; and Lord, dressed like a	
SLY.	
I am Christophero Sly; call not me honour nor lordship. I ne’er drank	
	
O, that a mighty man of such descent,	
Marian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of Wincot, if she know me not: if she	
	
O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth,	
Above the morning lark: or wilt thou hunt?	
And, till the tears that she hath shed for thee	
But did I never speak of all that time?	
THIRD SERVANT.	
Where is my wife?	
Here, noble lord: what is thy will with her?	
Are you my wife, and will not call me husband?	
I am your wife in all obedience.	
	
PAGE.	
For so your doctors hold it very meet,	
	
	
And by my father’s love and leave am arm’d	
A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep,	
Only, good master, while we do admire	
Such friends as time in Padua shall beget.	
[_To Baptista_] I pray you, sir, is it your will	
	
	
Peace, Tranio!	
	
	
Bianca’s grief.	
Go in, Bianca.	
Prefer them hither; for to cunning men	
	
Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not? What! shall I be appointed

LUCENTIO.	
I never thought it possible or likely;	
As Anna to the Queen of Carthage was,	
TRANIO.	
Such as the daughter of Agenor had,	
When with his knees he kiss’d the Cretan strand.	
Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.	
That till the father rid his hands of her,	
	
	
LUCENTIO.	
And be in Padua here Vincentio’s son;	
Visit his countrymen, and banquet them?	
_Basta_, content thee, for I have it full.	
Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.	
	
	
	
Or you stol’n his? or both? Pray, what’s the news?	
BIONDELLO.	
The better for him: would I were so too!	
But in all places else your master, Lucentio.	
	
PAGE.	
My lord, ’tis but begun.	
[_They sit and mark._]	
	
	
Hortensio; and I trow this is his house.	
	
GRUMIO.	
	
HORTENSIO.	
	
Nay, ’tis no matter, sir, what he ’leges in Latin. If this be not a	
pip out? Whom would to God I had well knock’d at first, then had not	
Haply to wive and thrive as best I may;	
Crowns in my purse I have, and goods at home,	
And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour’d wife?	
As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,	
I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;	
Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his mind is: why, give him	
Her name is Katherina Minola,	
PETRUCHIO.	
To give you over at this first encounter,	
For in Baptista’s keep my treasure is:	
A title for a maid of all titles the worst.	
	
	
A fine musician to instruct our mistress:	
Belov’d of me, and that my deeds shall prove.	
	
Born in Verona, old Antonio’s son.	
And I do hope good days and long to see.	
Have I not heard the sea, puff’d up with winds,	
Loud ’larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets’ clang?	
As will a chestnut in a farmer’s fire?	
	
This gentleman is happily arriv’d,	
	
Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way	
He that has the two fair daughters; is’t he you mean?	
	
	
PETRUCHIO.	
TRANIO.	
TRANIO.	
	
And were his daughter fairer than she is,	
Did you yet ever see Baptista’s daughter?	
As is the other for beauteous modesty.	
To whom we all rest generally beholding.	
Please ye we may contrive this afternoon,	
	
	
I’ll plead for you myself but you shall have him.	
BAPTISTA.	
What! will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see	
And, for your love to her, lead apes in hell.	
	
Within your house, to make mine eye the witness	
To instruct her fully in those sciences,	
She is not for your turn, the more my grief.	
give unto you this young scholar,	
A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio; welcome, good Cambio. [_To Tranio._]	
PETRUCHIO.	
After my death, the one half of my lands,	
And, for that dowry, I’ll assure her of	
So I to her, and so she yields to me;	
	
PETRUCHIO.	
That shake not though they blow perpetually.	
BAPTISTA.	
I think she’ll sooner prove a soldier:	
Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?	
And with that word she struck me on the head,	
[_To Hortensio_.] Well, go with me, and be not so discomfited;	
I will attend her here,	
	
KATHERINA.	
They call me Katherine that do talk of me.	
And bonny Kate, and sometimes Kate the curst;	
Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,—	
	
KATHERINA.	
Should be! should buz!	
KATHERINA.	
I swear I’ll cuff you if you strike again.	
	
KATHERINA.	
	
	
PETRUCHIO.	
Yet you are wither’d.	
And now I find report a very liar;	
With gentle conference, soft and affable.	
	
	
	
That you shall be my wife your dowry ’greed on;	
Re-enter Baptista, Gremio and Tranio.	
And to conclude, we have ’greed so well together	
That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.	
Be patient, gentlemen. I choose her for myself;	
She hung about my neck, and kiss on kiss	
Give me thy hand, Kate; I will unto Venice,	
GREMIO.	
Now is the day we long have looked for;	
Is richly furnished with plate and gold:	
Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls,	
If I may have your daughter to my wife,	
	
To give thee all, and in his waning age	
Set foot under thy table. Tut! a toy!	
’Tis in my head to do my master good:	
I see no reason but suppos’d Lucentio	
[_Exit._]	
LUCENTIO.	
And when in music we have spent an hour,	
Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.	
Was it not to refresh the mind of man	
Then give me leave to read philosophy,	
That will be never: tune your instrument.	
LUCENTIO.	
	
	
Madam, before you touch the instrument,	
I must begin with rudiments of art;	
	
_B mi_, Bianca, take him for thy lord,	
_D sol re_, one clef, two notes have I	
To change true rules for odd inventions.	
BAPTISTA.  [_To Tranio_.]	
Though he be merry, yet withal he’s honest.	
	
BAPTISTA.	
Is it new and old too? How may that be?	
Why, is it not news to hear of Petruchio’s coming?	
But say, what to thine old news?	
fives, stark spoiled with the staggers, begnawn with the bots, swayed	
	
Why, sir, he comes not.	
BIONDELLO.	
	
	
Nay, by Saint Jamy,	
	
	
An eye-sore to our solemn festival.	
And sent you hither so unlike yourself?	
’Twere well for Kate and better for myself.	
Doth watch Bianca’s steps so narrowly,	
	
GREMIO.	
TRANIO.	
	
Tut! she’s a lamb, a dove, a fool, to him.	
That down fell priest and book, and book and priest:	
But that his beard grew thin and hungerly	
Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play.	
But so it is, my haste doth call me hence,	
PETRUCHIO.	
Make it no wonder: if you knew my business,	
KATHERINA.	
I am content you shall entreat me stay;	
But yet not stay, entreat me how you can.	
GRUMIO.	
Nay, then,	
	
	
PETRUCHIO.	
	
Went they not quickly, I should die with laughing.	
	
	
You know there wants no junkets at the feast.	
She shall, Lucentio. Come, gentlemen, let’s go.	
SCENE I. A hall in PETRUCHIO’S country house.	
Enter Grumio.	
GRUMIO.	
Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and all foul ways! Was	
CURTIS.	
Who is that calls so coldly?	
	
	
GRUMIO.	
CURTIS.	
What’s that to thee?	
waded through the dirt to pluck him off me: how he swore; how she	
unexperienced to thy grave.	
CURTIS.	
They are.	
	
Enter Petrucio and Katherina.	
Where be these knaves? What! no man at door	
	
	
Nathaniel’s coat, sir, was not fully made,	
There was none fine but Adam, Ralph, and Gregory;	
[_Strikes him._]	
Where’s my spaniel Troilus? Sirrah, get you hence	
Where are my slippers? Shall I have some water?	
You heedless joltheads and unmanner’d slaves!	
The meat was well, if you were so contented.	
Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh.	
	
This way the coverlet, another way the sheets;	
Doth fancy any other but Lucentio?	
	
I read that I profess, _The Art to Love_.	
	
Quick proceeders, marry! Now tell me, I pray,	
Nor a musician as I seem to be;	
As one unworthy all the former favours	
In resolution as I swore before.	
Tranio, you jest; but have you both forsworn me?	
	
BIANCA.	
That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long,	
TRANIO.	
PEDANT.	
God save you, sir!	
TRANIO.	
PEDANT.	
But then up farther, and as far as Rome;	
First, tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?	
Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been,	
TRANIO.	
	
O, sir, I do; and will repute you ever	
This, by the way, I let you understand:	
	
	
	
KATHERINA.	
Signior Petruchio, fie! you are to blame.	
PETRUCHIO.	
With silken coats and caps, and golden rings,	
With amber bracelets, beads, and all this knavery.	
Here is the cap your worship did bespeak.	
PETRUCHIO.	
A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby’s cap:	
PETRUCHIO.	
HORTENSIO.	
	
	
	
Brav’d in mine own house with a skein of thread!	
I tell thee, I, that thou hast marr’d her gown.

GRUMIO.	
I confess two sleeves.	
should be cut out, and sew’d up again; and that I’ll prove upon thee,	
	
This is true that I say; and I had thee in place where thou shouldst	
	
You are i’ the right, sir; ’tis for my mistress.	
GRUMIO.	
	
SCENE IV. Padua. Before BAPTISTA’S house.	
Signior Baptista may remember me,	
TRANIO.	
Fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello,	
TRANIO.	
I am content, in a good father’s care,	
For curious I cannot be with you,	
Right true it is your son Lucentio here	
	
And happily we might be interrupted.	
Then at my lodging, and it like you:	
Send for your daughter by your servant here;	
BAPTISTA.	
It likes me well. Cambio, hie you home,	
And bid Bianca make her ready straight;	
[_Exeunt Tranio, Pedant and Baptista._]	
What say’st thou, Biondello?	
BIONDELLO.	
	
LUCENTIO.	
LUCENTIO.	
She will be pleas’d; then wherefore should I doubt?	
It shall go hard if Cambio go without her:	
	
PETRUCHIO.	
	
PETRUCHIO.	
It shall be moon, or star, or what I list,	
And if you please to call it a rush-candle,	
Petruchio, go thy ways; the field is won.	
[_To Vincentio_] Good morrow, gentle mistress; where away?	
That have been so bedazzled with the sun	
That everything I look on seemeth green:	
	
And bound I am to Padua, there to visit	
Let me embrace with old Vincentio;	
And wander we to see thy honest son,	
PETRUCHIO.	
Sir, here’s the door; this is Lucentio’s house:

Thou liest: his father is come from Padua, and here looking out at the

PEDANT.	
Enter one with an Officer.	
Thus strangers may be haled and abus’d: O monstrous villain!	
Re-enter Biondello, with Lucentio and Bianca.	
[_Biondello, Tranio and Pedant run out._]	
Cambio is chang’d into Lucentio.	
And happily I have arriv’d at the last	
	
without asking my good will?	
GREMIO.	
	
KATHERINA.	
KATHERINA.	
	
Enter Baptista, Vincentio, Gremio, the Pedant, Lucentio, Bianca,	
	
PETRUCHIO.	
You are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense:	
He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.	
Mistress, how mean you that?	
PETRUCHIO.	
And now you know my meaning.	
	
To her, Kate!	
	
	
	
Believe me, sir, they butt together well.	
BIANCA.	
	
Therefore a health to all that shot and miss’d.	
’Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself:	
A has a little gall’d me, I confess;	
BAPTISTA.	
PETRUCHIO.	
Who shall begin?	
	
I go.	
To come to me forthwith.	
PETRUCHIO.	
	
	
Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands.	
Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;	
	
She shall not.	
Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,	
And place your hands below your husband’s foot:

A nobler man, a braver warrior,	
That you withdraw you and abate your strength,	
Thy noble brother Titus and his sons,	
Commit myself, my person, and the cause.	
Rome, be as just and gracious unto me	
	
Romans, of five and twenty valiant sons,	
These that I bring unto their latest home,	
With burial amongst their ancestors.	
Why suffer'st thou thy sons, unburied yet,	
There greet in silence, as the dead are wont,	
Sweet cell of virtue and nobility,	
How many sons hast thou of mine in store	
A mother's tears in passion for her son;	
But must my sons be slaughtered in the streets	
For valiant doings in their country's cause?	
These are their brethren, whom your Goths beheld	
Whose smoke like incense doth perfume the sky.	
Here lurks no treason, here no envy swells,	
LAVINIA. In peace and honour live Lord Titus long;	
MARCUS. And welcome, nephews, from successful wars,	
And buried one and twenty valiant sons,	
Andronicus, would thou were shipp'd to hell	
The people will accept whom he admits.	
Lord Saturnine; whose virtues will, I hope,	
Tell me, Andronicus, doth this motion please thee?	
Presents well worthy Rome's imperious lord;	
Rome shall record; and when I do forget	
To him that for your honour and your state	
Princely shall be thy usage every way.	
Can make you greater than the Queen of Goths.	
Lavinia, you are not displeas'd with this?	
BASSIANUS. Ay, noble Titus, and resolv'd withal	
In wrongful quarrel you have slain your son.	
I'll trust by leisure him that mocks me once;	
In readiness for Hymenaeus stand-	
There shall we consummate our spousal rites.	
TITUS. No, foolish Tribune, no; no son of mine-	
MARCUS. No, noble Titus, but entreat of thee	
MARCUS. Brother, for in that name doth nature plead-	
TITUS. Speak thou no more, if all the rest will speed.	
His noble nephew here in virtue's nest,	
Nor wish no less; and so I take my leave.	
TAMORA. Not so, my lord; the gods of Rome forfend	
Whose fury not dissembled speaks his griefs.	
Then at my suit look graciously on him;	
[Aside to SATURNINUS]  My lord, be rul'd by me,	
And so supplant you for ingratitude,	
Which Rome reputes to be a heinous sin,	
To whom I sued for my dear son's life;	
Take up this good old man, and cheer the heart	
TAMORA. Titus, I am incorporate in Rome,	
For you, Prince Bassianus, I have pass'd	
And fear not, lords- and you, Lavinia.

And with thy weapon nothing dar'st perform.

You must perforce accomplish as you may.	
A speedier course than ling'ring languishment	
Must we pursue, and I have found the path.	
To cool this heat, a charm to calm these fits,	
Many good morrows to your Majesty!	
LAVINIA. I say no;	
I have been broad awake two hours and more.	
Know that this gold must coin a stratagem,	
The snakes lie rolled in the cheerful sun;	
The wand'ring prince and Dido once enjoyed,	
LAVINIA. Under your patience, gentle Emperess,	
Jove shield your husband from his hounds to-day!	
LAVINIA. And, being intercepted in your sport,	
Great reason that my noble lord be rated	
Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven.

That gave thee life when well he might have slain thee,

DEMETRIUS. Away! for thou hast stay'd us here too long.	
This is the hole where Aaron bid us hide him.	
	
Straight will I bring you to the loathsome pit	
Where I espied the panther fast asleep.	
A very fatal place it seems to me.	
My heart suspects more than mine eye can see.	
A precious ring that lightens all this hole,	
When he by night lay bath'd in maiden blood.

O, could our mourning case thy misery!                Exeunt

Whose souls are not corrupted as 'tis thought.	
Because they died in honour's lofty bed.

Or brought a fagot to bright-burning Troy?	
Thou hast no hands to wipe away thy tears,	
Perchance because she knows them innocent.

Enter AARON the Moor	
TITUS. O gracious Emperor! O gentle Aaron!

To ransom my two nephews from their death;

MARCUS. My hand shall go.	
Exeunt LUCIUS and MARCUS	
AARON.  [Aside]  If that be call'd deceit, I will be honest,	
	
TITUS. Now stay your strife. What shall be is dispatch'd.	
As for my sons, say I account of them	
[Aside]  Their heads I mean. O, how this villainy	
Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it!	
TITUS. O, here I lift this one hand up to heaven,	
I am the sea; hark how her sighs do blow.	
Then give me leave; for losers will have leave	
	
More than remembrance of my father's death.             Exit	
But sorrow flouted at is double death.	
MARCUS. Alas, poor heart, that kiss is comfortless	
Struck pale and bloodless; and thy brother, I,	
Rent off thy silver hair, thy other hand	
Gnawing with thy teeth; and be this dismal sight	
And threat me I shall never come to bliss	
And make proud Saturnine and his emperess	
	
TITUS. So so, now sit; and look you eat no more	
[To LAVINIA]  Thou map of woe, that thus dost talk in signs!	
Wound it with sighing, girl, kill it with groans;	
Such violent hands upon her tender life.	
Lest we remember still that we have none.	
She says she drinks no other drink but tears,	
In thy dumb action will I be as perfect	
What dost thou strike at, Marcus, with thy knife?

Extremity of griefs would make men mad;

And rape, I fear, was root of thy annoy.

Ay, such a place there is where we did hunt-	
That left the camp to sin in Lucrece' bed?	
Lord Junius Brutus sware for Lucrece' rape-	
That we will prosecute, by good advice,	
And where's our lesson, then? Boy, what say you?

And not relent, or not compassion him?

And bear it from me to the Emperess.

Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.	
AARON. Swear that he shall, and then I will begin.

To save my boy, to nourish and bring him up;	
And hid the gold within that letter mention'd,

To do this outrage; and it now is done.

And she whom mighty kingdoms curtsy to,	
The story of that baleful burning night,	
When subtle Greeks surpris'd King Priam's Troy.	
While I stand by and weep to hear him speak.	
That have preserv'd her welfare in my blood	
And bring our Emperor gently in thy hand,

THE END	
	
A plaintful story from a sist'ring vale,	
Which fortified her visage from the sun,	
Oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne,	
For some, untucked, descended her sheaved hat,	
Of amber, crystal, and of beaded jet,	
Of court, of city, and had let go by	
Towards this afflicted fancy fastly drew;	
	
Like unshorn velvet, on that termless skin,	
Yet showed his visage by that cost more dear;	
	
Or he his manage by th' well-doing steed.	
To appertainings and to ornament,	
Catching all passions in his craft of will,	
'Yet did I not, as some my equals did,	
Demand of him, nor being desired yielded;	
'Nor gives it satisfaction to our blood	
That we must curb it upon others' proof,	
'And long upon these terms I held my city,	
For feasts of love I have been called unto,	
Are errors of the blood, none of the mind;	
With twisted metal amorously empleached,	
	
'"Lo, this device was sent me from a nun,	
But kept cold distance, and did thence remove	
To spend her living in eternal love.	
The scars of battle scapeth by the flight,	
	
'"O pardon me in that my boast is true!	
Upon the moment did her force subdue,	
Believed her eyes when they t'assail begun,	
Whose sights till then were levelled on my face;	
Each cheek a river running from a fount	
	
Of burning blushes or of weeping water,	
Against the thing he sought he would exclaim;	
That th' unexperient gave the tempter place,	
'Gainst whom the world could not hold argument,	
A woman I forswore; but I will prove,	
Thou being a goddess, I forswore not thee:

To win his heart, she touch'd him here and there:	
If love make me forsworn, how shall I swear to love?	
Scarce had the sun dried up the dewy morn,	
A longing tarriance for Adonis made,	
Between each kiss her oaths of true love swearing!	
Her faith, her oaths, her tears, and all were jestings.	
She burn'd with love, as straw with fire flameth;	
That Phoebus' lute, the queen of music, makes;	
Fair creature, kill'd too soon by death's sharp sting!	
For why? I craved nothing of thee still:	
And as he fell to her, so fell she to him.	
And as she fetched breath, away he skips,

THE RAPE OF LUCRECE	
meeting one evening at the tent of Sextus Tarquinius, the king's son,	
with the rest back to the camp; from whence he shortly after privily	
moved, that with one consent and a general acclamation the Tarquins	
And to Collatium bears the lightless fire	
And girdle with embracing flames the waist	
	
That kings might be espoused to more fame,	
Of that rich jewel he should keep unknown	
	
Where, lest between them both it should be kill'd,	
Which, having all, all could not satisfy;	
That, cloy'd with much, he pineth still for more.	
Nor read the subtle-shining secrecies	
	
And every one to rest themselves betake,	
The sundry dangers of his will's obtaining;	
For what they have not, that which they possess	
Of that we have: so then we do neglect	
When heavy sleep had closed up mortal eyes:	
	
Whereat a waxen torch forthwith he lighteth,	
	
What following sorrow may on this arise;	
And die, unhallow'd thoughts, before you blot	
Offer pure incense to so pure a shrine:	
To cipher me how fondly I did dote;	
Shall curse my bones, and hold it for no sin	
	
Who buys a minute's mirth to wail a week?	
Or what fond beggar, but to touch the crown,	
Post hither, this vile purpose to prevent?	
But, coward-like, with trembling terror die.	
Urging the worser sense for vantage still;	
Which in a moment doth confound and kill	
	
Until her husband's welfare she did hear;	
	
Each one by him enforc'd retires his ward;	
As who should say this glove to wanton tricks	
That for his prey to pray he doth begin,	
To wink, being blinded with a greater light:	
Whether it is that she reflects so bright,	
But blind they are, and keep themselves enclosed.	
In his clear bed might have reposed still:	
Her breasts, like ivory globes circled with blue,	
These worlds in Tarquin new ambition bred:	
As the grim lion fawneth o'er his prey,	
His eye, which late this mutiny restrains,	
Gives the hot charge and bids them do their liking.	
	
Like to a new-kill'd bird she trembling lies;	
Thus he replies: 'The colour in thy face,	
Thy never-conquer'd fort: the fault is thine,	
Which, like a falcon towering in the skies,	
Nor aught obeys but his foul appetite.	
Hindering their present fall by this dividing;	
By knighthood, gentry, and sweet friendship's oath,	
	
He is no woodman that doth bend his bow	
O, if no harder than a stone thou art,	
Hast thou put on his shape to do him shame?	
When they in thee the like offences prove:	
He learn'd to sin, and thou didst teach the way?	
Let him return, and flattering thoughts retire:	
Turns not, but swells the higher by this let.	
Add to his flow, but alter not his taste.'	
	
Shame folded up in blind concealing night,	
That ever modest eyes with sorrow shed.	
That through the length of times he stands disgrac'd:	
She stays, exclaiming on the direful night;	
'For day,' quoth she, 'night's scapes doth open lay;	
And grave, like water that doth eat in steel,	
	
Blind muffled bawd! dark harbour for defame!	
The light will show, character'd in my brow,	
Will quote my loathsome trespass in my looks.	
The orator, to deck his oratory,	
The branches of another root are rotted,	
Besides, of weariness he did complain him,	
That some impurity doth not pollute.	
	
Having no other pleasure of his gain	
Who in their pride do presently abuse it:	
But ill-annexed Opportunity	
How comes it then, vile Opportunity,	
From the creation to the general doom.	
'Mis-shapen Time, copesmate of ugly night,	
	
Cancell'd my fortunes, and enchained me	
'Time's glory is to calm contending kings,	
And smear with dust their glittering golden towers:	
'To fill with worm-holes stately monuments,	
To cheer the ploughman with increaseful crops,	
To make him moan; but pity not his moans:	
Let him have time of Time's help to despair,	
At his own shadow let the thief run mad!	
Such wretched hands such wretched blood should spill:	
For greatest scandal waits on greatest state.	
To find some desperate instrument of death:	
'In vain,' quoth she, 'I live, and seek in vain	
But when I fear'd I was a loyal wife:	
A badge of fame to slander's livery;	
I will not wrong thy true affection so,	
Nor fold my fault in cleanly-coin'd excuses;	
By this; lamenting Philomel had ended	
And therefore still in night would cloister'd be.	
And seems to point her out where she sits weeping,	
Why pryest thou through my window? leave thy peeping;	
Holds disputation with each thing she views,	
True sorrow then is feelingly suffic'd	
	
Within your hollow-swelling feather'd breasts,	
And in my hearing be you mute and dumb!	
Shall tune our heart-strings to true languishment.	
	
To live or die which of the twain were better,	
'To kill myself,' quoth she, 'alack! what were it,	
That mother tries a merciless conclusion	
So must my soul, her bark being peel'd away.	
If in this blemish'd fort I make some hole	
And, for my sake, serve thou false Tarquin so.	
	
Poor Lucrece' cheeks unto her maid seem so	
Even so the maid with swelling drops 'gan wet	
Who in a salt-wav'd ocean quench their light,	
Like ivory conduits coral cisterns filling:	
Wherein is stamp'd the semblance of a devil.	
Their smoothness, like a goodly champaign plain,	
By that her death, to do her husband wrong:	
	
To the poor counterfeit of her complaining:	
For more it is than I can well express:	
What wit sets down is blotted straight with will;	
Some present speed to come and visit me:	
To shun this blot, she would not blot the letter	
For then the eye interprets to the ear	
'Tis but a part of sorrow that we hear:	
	
To talk in deeds, while others saucily	
The more she thought he spied in her some blemish.	
The very eyes of men through loopholes thrust,	
That one might see those far-off eyes look sad.	
And here and there the painter interlaces	
As't were encouraging the Greeks to fight;	
Some high, some low, the painter was so nice:	
In her the painter had anatomiz'd	
Wanting the spring that those shrunk pipes had fed,	
And with my knife scratch out the angry eyes	
Here feelingly she weeps Troy's painted woes:	
She throws her eyes about the painting round,	
To hide deceit, and give the harmless show	
A brow unbent, that seem'd to welcome woe;	
And therein so ensconc'd his secret evil,	
And chid the painter for his wondrous skill;	
	
	
By deep surmise of others' detriment:	
To think their dolour others have endur'd.	
Both stood, like old acquaintance in a trance,	
Met far from home, wondering each other's chance.	
In me more woes than words are now depending;	
	
And then against my heart he sets his sword,	
So should my shame still rest upon record,	
And far the weaker with so strong a fear:	
'O, teach me how to make mine own excuse!	
That was not forc'd; that never was inclin'd	
With head declin'd, and voice damm'd up with woe,	
With sad set eyes, and wretched arms across,	
What he breathes out his breath drinks up again.	
	
	
For 'tis a meritorious fair design	
	
	
Thou wast not to this end from me deriv'd	
	
And shiver'd all the beauty of my glass,	
	
Held back his sorrow's tide, to make it more;	
Replies her husband: 'do not take away	
My sorrow's interest; let no mourner say	
Let my unsounded self, suppos'd a fool,	
'Why, Collatine, is woe the cure for woe?	
	
Her wrongs to us, and by this bloody knife,	
And that deep vow, which Brutus made before,	
	
Saith that the world hath ending with thy life.     12	
Earth’s sovereign salve to do a goddess good:         28	
Then with her windy sighs and golden hairs	
She feedeth on the steam, as on a prey,	
Perforce will force it overflow the bank.           72	
From his soft bosom never to remove,	
And for my sake hath learn’d to sport and dance,	
To toy, to wanton, dally, smile, and jest;	
Making my arms his field, his tent my bed.         108	
	
But having no defects, why dost abhor me?	
	
“Witness this primrose bank whereon I lie:           151	
That thine may live when thou thyself art dead;      172	
And so in spite of death thou dost survive,	
And now Adonis with a lazy spright,	
	
And lo I lie between that sun and thee:	
O had thy mother borne so hard a mind,	
Speak, fair; but speak fair words, or else be mute:  208	
For men will kiss even by their own direction.”    216	
“Within this limit is relief enough,	
“Pity,” she cries; “some favour, some remorse!”	
Away he springs, and hasteth to his horse.	
The strong-neck’d steed, being tied unto a tree,	
Upon his compass’d crest now stand on end;           272	
Shows his hot courage and his high desire.         276	
So did this horse excel a common one,	
And where he run or fly they know not whether;       304	
For through his mane and tail the high wind sings,	
He looks upon his love, and neighs unto her;	
When lo the unback’d breeder, full of fear,         320	
For lovers say, the heart hath treble wrong,	
When it is barr’d the aidance of the tongue.	
Looks on the dull earth with disturbed mind,         340	
Taking no notice that she is so nigh,	
But now her cheek was pale, and by and by	
It flash’d forth fire, as lightning from the sky.  348	
As apt as new-fall’n snow takes any dint.	
Oh what a war of looks was then between them,	
Once more the engine of her thoughts began:	
My heart all whole as thine, thy heart my wound,	
Then love’s deep groans I never shall regard,	
Welcomes the warm approach of sweet desire,	
Servilely master’d with a leathern rein!             392	
To touch the fire, the weather being cold?	
And once made perfect, never lost again.”          408	
Unless it be a boar, and then I chase it;	
“You hurt my hand with wringing. Let us part,	
Though neither eyes nor ears, to hear nor see,	
And at his look she flatly falleth down	
Claps her pale cheek, till clapping makes it red.  468	
Like the fair sun when in his fresh array	
“O where am I?” quoth she, “in earth or heaven?	
And as they last, their verdure still endure,	
And pay them at thy leisure, one by one,	
“Fair queen,” quoth he, “if any love you owe me,	
Measure my strangeness with my unripe years:         524	
No fisher but the ungrown fry forbears:	
His day’s hot task hath ended in the west;	
Till breathless he disjoin’d, and backward drew	
While she takes all she can, not all she listeth.  564	
Tell me, love’s master, shall we meet tomorrow	
Say, shall we? shall we? wilt thou make the match?”	
Usurps her cheek, she trembles at his tale,	
And on his neck her yoking arms she throws.          592	
She sinketh down, still hanging by his neck,	
She seeks to kindle with continual kissing.	
Of bristly pikes, that ever threat his foes;         620	
To which love’s eyes pay tributary gazes;            632	
Would root these beauties as he roots the mead.	
This canker that eats up love’s tender spring,       656	
That sometime true news, sometime false doth bring,	
Under whose sharp fangs on his back doth lie	
And fear doth teach it divination:	
Or at the fox which lives by subtilty,	
Pursue these fearful creatures o’er the downs,	
	
“Sometime he runs among a flock of sheep,	
To stop the loud pursuers in their yell,             688	
Then do they spend their mouths: echo replies,	
To hearken if his foes pursue him still.	
	
“Leave me, and then the story aptly ends:            716	
“I am,” quoth he, “expected of my friends;	
For stealing moulds from heaven, that were divine;	
To mingle beauty with infirmities,	
	
And barren dearth of daughters and of sons,	
“So in thyself thyself art made away;	
A mischief worse than civil home-bred strife,        764	
No, lady, no; my heart longs not to groan,	
You do it for increase: O strange excuse!	
	
Love surfeits not, lust like a glutton dies;	
With this he breaketh from the sweet embrace         811	
And homeward through the dark laund runs apace;	
Fold in the object that did feed her sight.	
Having lost the fair discovery of her way.         828	
Her heavy anthem still concludes in woe,	
For who hath she to spend the night withal,	
And would say after her, if she said “No.”         852	
Lo here the gentle lark, weary of rest,	
	
	
She tells them ’tis a causeless fantasy,	
To whom she speaks, and he replies with howling.	
So she at these sad sighs draws up her breath,	
But through the flood-gates breaks the silver rain,	
All entertain’d, each passion labours so,	
Not to believe, and yet too credulous;	
Yet pardon me, I felt a kind of fear	
	
I did but act, he’s author of my slander.	
Thus hoping that Adonis is alive,                   1009	
Tells him of trophies, statues, tombs and stories	
	
Upon the wide wound that the boar had trench’d	
But stole his blood and seem’d with him to bleed.	
Of things long since, or anything ensuing?          1078	
	
Play with his locks; then would Adonis weep;	
And straight, in pity of his tender years,	
Ne’er saw the beauteous livery that he wore;	
She looks upon his lips, and they are pale;	
And every beauty robb’d of his effect.              1132	
And set dissension ’twixt the son and sire;         1160	
And yokes her silver doves; by whose swift aid
